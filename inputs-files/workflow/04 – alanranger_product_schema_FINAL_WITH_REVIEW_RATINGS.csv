What stood out most was his hands-on approach—plenty of practical exercises, real-time feedback, and creative challenges that helped me grow in confidence behind the camera. He also has a great eye for detail and composition, and his tips on lighting and editing were game-changers for me.  Highly recommend to anyone serious about improving their photography.

His expertise and constructive critique during the first session enabled him to tailor a session suitable for me for No 2. We discussed black and white photography and concentrated on editing some of my previous shots using software add-ons to the Lightroom program, which I already use. While I am by no means anywhere near expert quality, Alans teaching style has given me the confidence to take my photography to the next level. Alan offers as many 1-2-1 sessions as you feel you will need, but for me, I have chosen to use my other 2 sessions in a workshop situation, allowing me to get out and about with other photographers in the field and learn more techniques with guidance from Alan. One real positive that has come from this was an immediate solution to a problem I had been suffering with my photo editing. This was due to Lightroom being updated recently and my Mac not being able to cope. Since upgrading my RAM, following Alans recommendation, the performance and speed of my software has been much improved, allowing my to spend more time doing decent edits instead of waiting like I was before. Many thanks for all your help so far, and looking forward to the next one."",

His deep knowledge and approachable teaching style made the lesson valuable for both beginners and advanced photographers alike. He helped us set up our cameras and provided clear explanations of the fundamental principles, ensuring everyone got the most out of the experience."",

Mostly a brief overview of the non-automatic modes and then you're sent out to take pictures. What this means is you don't really learn anything. I was therefore a bit cautious about booking this one in case it was similar. It couldn't have been more different.  I recently completed the 'Get Off Auto' course as a taster session and found this to be excellent. Alan covers everything you need to known in a 2.5 hour session and rather than sending you out blindly to take photo's - these are given as exercises to complete in your own time - meaning you have more time to explore each topic and ask the questions that you really want to ask.   The first week introduction is a good starter and is the natural lead in to the 4 week beginners course."",

          ""reviewBody"": ""I recently attended a photographic workshop hosted by Alan, and I can't express how invaluable the experience was. Initially, I felt overwhelmed with the intricate settings of my camera, but Alan demystified them in a way that was both comprehensible and reassuring. Beyond the technicalities, he instilled in me the ability to 'see' a photograph – to truly understand the essence of a scene and capture it effectively. He also provided hands-on guidance with my tripod, ensuring I maximized its potential for stable, crisp shots.  For anyone keen on elevating their photography skills, whether you're a beginner or someone looking to refine your craft, I would highly recommend Alan's courses. His expertise, coupled with his patient and insightful teaching style, truly sets him apart.  I hope this helps, and I'm glad I had such a positive experience! Remember to continue practicing and experimenting with your camera; the world of photography is vast and constantly evolving!"",

I love it, but have no idea how to use all the settings to get the best out of it, so after seeing the 'photography made easy' course online, I decided to book onto it.     I found out after booking that the course was a 'lecture' format so I was a bit skeptical, thinking that I probably wouldn't learn a whole lot. I was completely wrong! Although it's not practical, it is really interactive and Alan encourages lots of participation, questions, thoughts etc. The course covers the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO etc. necessary for you to go home and experiment, knowing what all the settings on the camera dial are. Alan was very patient and didn't mind explaining numerous times what certain things are when the class for confused!    I enjoyed the course very much and I have now signed up to the extended course, because I believe I will greatly benefit from doing practical work with Alan. Thank you very much!"",

Alan took us to brilliant locations and made sure everyone was comfortable with both the creative aspect of 'seeing the shot' and then attempting to execute it but fortunately stopped short of taking the shot for us to ensure we really learned from the experience. The evening feedback sessions reviewing our shots enabled us to modify technique on the subsequent days to improve the quality of our images.  He also helped me use Christmas presents like Expodisc to great effect and navigate the menus of my new Sony camera.  The domestic arrangements were also very good with friendly staff who were not fazed by a group of photopapers with muddy boots."",

He was happy to help with any questions or advice you need, but you need to ask for help if you want it, otherwise he will leave you alone to do what you want; which suited me.  I have come back with more good photographs from one weekend trip than I would normally manage to get in a year."",

I can highly recommend Alan to everyone who would like to start the adventure with photography or improve the photography skills."",

I was not upset about the cancellation as the reason was due to a change in conditions and the I was pleased it didn't go ahead when there would be nothing to photograph.  It then took many attempts to find a date that worked for myself and for Alan.    The details for joining the workshop came a couple of days before the event.  It did recommend a filter that I didn't have but it was too late to buy it from Amazon.  No real problem through as we did really need it.  The first 15 minutes of the workshop were tuition and I picked up a few very useful tips from the workshop which I will use in future.  The rest of the workshop is you photograph the subject and move around the site at your own pace but not too far from the group so Alan can move around each individual and answer questions, review photos and give advice.  You are expected to ask questions and learn more that way.  I personally find that I don't think of questions until much later when the learning experience has really soaked in.  So it would have been good to stop and specifically talk about a topic.    I plan to visit the location again on a different day and try again now I have seen my photos.  I will definitely consider booking again in the future depending on the subjects."",

I found Alan really high energy and passionate about photography, which meant I came away feeling like I'd learnt a lot and excited about using my new knowledge.

The workshop was well-organized, with a detailed schedule and excellent information about each location — including the best times for sunrise, sunset, high tide, and low tide. Everything we needed to know was clearly explained and thoughtfully planned.  The choice of locations was perfect for training and practice. Each spot offered unique opportunities to experiment with composition, light, and timing. I must admit, I learned a lot of useful techniques, creative ideas, and ways to think differently about each shot — especially the importance of being patient and waiting for the right moment.  There were only three of us in total, which made the experience even more personal and interactive. I also learned a great deal from my fellow participants. The commuting distances between locations were short and comfortable, and Alan proved to be not only an excellent tutor but also an excellent driver!  Overall, this workshop was both educational and inspiring. I’m truly grateful for the experience and hope to join Alan again for more workshops in other locations."",

He gave me clear and specific tuition, with guidance and advice tailored just for me. He was always willing to answer my questions and explain his approach to shooting images.

The gorge is wooded with a stream, the Burbage Brook, at the bottom. Padley provides numerous opportunities to refine your composition in many aspects. You can opt for close-up sketches of woodland growth, rocks and water or tackle a wider vista showing the river and work on long exposures, water abstracts and much more.Bolehill Quarry - Created hundreds of millions of years ago by the power of natural forces, the last few centuries have seen the rugged landscape surrounding Padley Gorge sculpted by man who long ago quarried these gritstone Edges for stone and tunnelled deep beneath the moors to drive a railway line through the hills. Now an area of outstanding natural beauty, this walk takes in the breathtaking heights of Millstone Edge and majestic silver birch woodlands. It's a great location for any level of photographer to hone their skills and techniques."",

We went to various locations so that everyone could get something including a lovely sun rise in Craster so time management was essential and Alan was flexible throughout the weekend adjusting the timetable so that we got the most out of the time we were in Northumbria. Restaurant on the Friday night was a good choice, nice food, also the fish and chip shop on the Friday excellent and good prices.  Not so good - hotel looked very nice from the pictures, but hygiene was a big issue for me, mouldy bath mat which got changed once I asked, and there was mould on the shower panel it is in need of refurbishment, bedroom furniture MFI quite flimsy.  I understand why Alan has selected it as it was conveniently located but they do need to address  these issues I am sure he will feed back to them as its in an ideal location."",

I always enjoy my time on workshops etc but this one was particular memorable  as Alan cleverly maximised the opportunities presented by the challenging weather conditions (wild and windy). I learned lots about making the most of the conditions and used quite advanced photography techniques - for example, long exposures, bracketing and taking more than one shot to subsequently 'mask' in photoshop. Great too to be out in the environment instead of huddled indoors!"",

Was great to be able let Alan do the driving so we could relax between venues and concentrate on taking pictures. Felt Alan got the balance slightly wrong on first day between leaving us to our own devices without being invasive and perhaps offering more advice/help but given his 5 hour drive and the fact all three of us said we had at least 20 years of experience I wasn’t too bothered. Alan was very informative and helpful on 2nd and 3rd day with technical and artistic advice. Great locations and his knowledge of the area was very helpful in achieving some really good results which he was very helpful at dinner in giving advice on. Hands on advice of camera features and technical ideas really improved my results over the 3 days combined with being able to look through Alan’s camera at his framing and his final results at the various locations. Great choice of accommodation too with enjoyable meals to start and finish the days with chance to talk through the day and plan the next.   Will definitely be going on another workshop with Alan."",

It was extremely well organised, with a detailed itinerary which covered a huge range of locations to suit all tastes. His knowledge of the locations and where to get the best shots was excellent. The itinerary was adjusted according to the changes in weather and worked brilliantly. There was opportunity to try new techniques and creative styles with tuition or you can just do what you normally do in a beautiful place.  There were plenty of loo stops, a great B&B and some fantastic places to eat. I valued Alan's direct feedback and guidance, but he won't mince his words and will be honest and clear! Alan was always available for input but his style is not to be in your face, which our group appreciated. He is extremely knowledgable and skilled but is able to pitch things at the right level for the range of skill across the group. His good humour made the weekend great fun for all. Thanks"",

I received emails prior to the event with a list of equipment and directions to the course.  It was a small group, a relaxed atmosphere. Alan gave a small teaching session prior to starting the workshop. He explained anything you needed to learn and helped you understand depending on your knowledge/experience of photography.  There were four of us on the workshop. Alan gave us all one to one tuition. He displayed our images on a large screen and talked us through composition etc. He gave praise and constructive criticism, all on a one to one basis. I learned alot that day. I liked the way he offers tuition no matter what level you are.  He showed us some of his photography which was interesting. He really is a master in the field.  I highly recommend a photography course with him. I'd like to do more courses in the future.  Many thanks Alan for an enjoyable and most beautiful workshop in your stunning garden of mature plants and flowers. You really have a creative mind and I'm so glad you can teach your valuable photography skills to benefit others."",

He chooses nice places to stay and the social aspect is good too. I'd recommend the workshops although the Gower in June is going to be a challenge because of the time of year. Although it's nicer to stand outdoors in the summer, workshops in autumn and winter would be my preference. Anyway, if you're thinking of booking or buying a gift for someone.....do it!"",

It's a perfect spot to admire the sunset and, on a clear night, is a designated 'Dark Skies' stargazing location. To access this special place, head uphill in a northerly direction from the car park and find the strangely shaped Mother Cap stone. Then, marvel at the vivid stars filling the Peak District's dark skies.The Roaches, with Hen Cloud and Ramshaw Rocks, form a gritstone escarpment that marks the Peak's south-western edge.
