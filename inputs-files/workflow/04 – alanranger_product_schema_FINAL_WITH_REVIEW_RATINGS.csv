The group was a small group which gave time for when you wanted to ask questions and for Alan to give time to individual students.  There was a lot of content which you could only fully take in by going home and reviewing / studying it.  Alan has a dry sense of humour which helped make the sessions enjoyable."",

Having the feedback for your images both educational and a boost in confidence. Can't put a price on what this course has taught me. Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level. But I learned more about the technical side of photography in the last 5 weeks than I did in all that previous time. A perfect spring board to take my photography that step further, and hopefully allow me to do what I love for a living.

Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.  There are flexible payment options available and I approached Alan initially to discuss my needs and he tailored a plan suitable for what I wanted to achieve."",

I'm not a car owner so I was extremely grateful that Alan was putting his courses on here in Kenilworth.  I really got everything I was looking for with Alan. He gives it his all and you certainly get value for money"",

The only reason I've stopped is because I improved and ended up with too much work. His mentoring is something I would recommend and that I'd go back to if I felt I needed more help in the future"",

      ""reviewBody"": ""Absolutely excellent course. The 5 week beginners course was perfect for me. Alan is a brilliant teacher who explains things clearly and in an easy-to-understand way. He takes the time to make sure everyone understands and is happy to go over things again and again. The weekly assignments are fun and challenge you to think differently about your photography. Having the feedback for your images both educational and a boost in confidence. Can't put a price on what this course has taught me. Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level. But I learned more about the technical side of photography in the last 5 weeks than I did in all that previous time. A perfect spring board to take my photography that step further, and hopefully allow me to do what I love for a living. When time and money allow, I fully intend on going on future courses and workshops."",

I had attended a prior 1-day course with another company, and so my expectations were set around what I had experienced. However, after attending this course I was truly blown away.  Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.  There are flexible payment options available and I approached Alan initially to discuss my needs and he tailored a plan suitable for what I wanted to achieve."",

He takes the time to make sure everyone understands and is happy to go over things again and again. The weekly assignments are fun and challenge you to think differently about your photography. Having the feedback for your images both educational and a boost in confidence. Can't put a price on what this course has taught me. Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level. But I learned more about the technical side of photography in the last 5 weeks than I did in all that previous time. A perfect spring board to take my photography that step further, and hopefully allow me to do what I love for a living. When time and money allow, I fully intend on going on future courses and workshops."",

I had attended a prior 1-day course with another company, and so my expectations were set around what I had experienced. However, after attending this course I was truly blown away.  Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.  There are flexible payment options available and I approached Alan initially to discuss my needs and he tailored a plan suitable for what I wanted to achieve."",

His knowledge and expertise is boundless and what is so refreshing is his willingness to share it!    That might sound odd, given you're paying for tuition, but you get so much more than simple facts, lessons and techniques.  Alan shares best practice, based on years of experience.  His passion and drive and love for his craft is evident.  A highly creative and artistic eye coupled with oodles of technical know-how, acres of experience and exceptionally high standards, and you've got yourself a tutor who raises the bar and challenges you to do the same.

Alan you deserve a big pat on the back for not only having the foresight to put a course like this together but providing students with the opportunity to go through a complete end to end process culminating in a public exhibition.

This is about him providing a structured project to See Design Shoot Enhance and Share your panel of images with his experience, guidance and support every step of the way.   Week 1 presented 9 nervous strangers all of whom thought they were completely out of their depth and wondering what the hell they were doing there.  16 weeks later we left as good friends having helped and supported each other throughout, confident in approaching the next stage of our photographic journey.

He takes the time to make sure everyone understands and is happy to go over things again and again. The weekly assignments are fun and challenge you to think differently about your photography. Having the feedback for your images both educational and a boost in confidence. Can't put a price on what this course has taught me. Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level. But I learned more about the technical side of photography in the last 5 weeks than I did in all that previous time. A perfect spring board to take my photography that step further, and hopefully allow me to do what I love for a living. When time and money allow, I fully intend on going on future courses and workshops."",

      ""reviewBody"": ""I enrolled onto the 4-week beginner's course with Alan, run from Kenilworth. I had attended a prior 1-day course with another company, and so my expectations were set around what I had experienced. However, after attending this course I was truly blown away.  Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.  There are flexible payment options available and I approached Alan initially to discuss my needs and he tailored a plan suitable for what I wanted to achieve."",

      ""reviewBody"": ""Absolutely excellent course. The 5 week beginners course was perfect for me. Alan is a brilliant teacher who explains things clearly and in an easy-to-understand way. He takes the time to make sure everyone understands and is happy to go over things again and again. The weekly assignments are fun and challenge you to think differently about your photography. Having the feedback for your images both educational and a boost in confidence. Can't put a price on what this course has taught me. Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level. But I learned more about the technical side of photography in the last 5 weeks than I did in all that previous time. A perfect spring board to take my photography that step further, and hopefully allow me to do what I love for a living. When time and money allow, I fully intend on going on future courses and workshops."",

I had attended a prior 1-day course with another company, and so my expectations were set around what I had experienced. However, after attending this course I was truly blown away.  Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.  There are flexible payment options available and I approached Alan initially to discuss my needs and he tailored a plan suitable for what I wanted to achieve."",

After giving us some advice and a short demonstration he sent us off for half an hour to select our subject matter.  He then provided each of us with hands on guidance on how to take the best shots from both an artistic and technical point of view.  For example, he showed me some tricks available in my camera that I didn't know existed, and I'd never realized just how beautiful an oak leaf can be.

The information that Alan provided in advance was very comprehensive, and included not just equipment required but also advice on clothing and food and drink. Not surprisingly, the theme of the workshop was 'Autumn leaves', and Alan started by stressing the importance of composition:no matter how expensive your kit or how technically skilled you are, these are of little value if what's in the frame is not interesting. After giving us some advice and a short demonstration he sent us off for half an hour to select our subject matter.  He then provided each of us with hands on guidance on how to take the best shots from both an artistic and technical point of view.  For example, he showed me some tricks available in my camera that I didn't know existed, and I'd never realized just how beautiful an oak leaf can be. In a few hours I learned a lot about photography in general and my camera's features in particular. For me, a very successful and inspiring day."",

      ""reviewBody"": ""Very good session on autumn photography at Batsford arboretum (apparently TrustPilot don't allow links, so Google \""Alan Ranger Batsford\"" :-) ). Particular good points: some good refreshers on very basic stuff (eg. custom white balance and using exposure bracketing), and some more advanced techniques on abstracts.  I've done a couple of photography workshops now, but this was the first with Alan Ranger. This one's easily the best value for money: much more one-on-one time with the instructor than most, and more effort to tailor to the students' particular needs/requirements."",

      ""reviewBody"": ""I attended one of Alan's workshop at Batsford arboretum. Had a great day and came away with many new skills and ideas, which I feel will give me something to think about, build on and improve my photography. Only 4 of us, so a nice small group with plenty of one to one tuition as needed.  A lot of emphasis was placed on observation and carefully choosing and thinking about what a shot should show and say, and trying to develop an eye for an interesting picture (Rather than just point and click); we experimented with taking shots for colour, landscape vistas, and close up macro photography of leaves, flowers, and fungi.    I also learnt a lot more about what my camera can do in terms of settings, exposures, focusing and light metering. I thought I knew my camera fairly well, but now can get so much more out of it.  In conclusion;  a fabulous day, with good company in a beautiful location, and I would have no hesitation in recommending."",

Different abilities within the workshop were catered for so well and the ratio of time to have a play and work things out for myself to teaching time was perfect. I was so chuffed with the photos that I left the workshop with, and felt so motivated and inspired. I would definitely recommend the 4 hour workshop to friends and family and hopefully will book onto another training session asap!!"",

On the day, I was a little bit worried as I am very much a beginner. I felt embarrassed at times as I couldn't work my very own camera but I also felt at ease, included and guided. I never expected to come out of one workshop and be a professional. Alan was patient, knowledgeable and on hand. I now understand my camera a little more. I had a lovely morning with a great group of people, walking in mud and learning how to take a picture. Thank you Alan for a great experience! I will be looking to book in the future!"",

I never expected to come out of one workshop and be a professional. Alan was patient, knowledgeable and on hand. I now understand my camera a little more.

Alan was very informative and helpful on 2nd and 3rd day with technical and artistic advice. Great locations and his knowledge of the area was very helpful in achieving some really good results which he was very helpful at dinner in giving advice on. Hands on advice of camera features and technical ideas really improved my results over the 3 days combined with being able to look through Alan’s camera at his framing and his final results at the various locations.

We went to various locations so that everyone could get something including a lovely sun rise in Craster so time management was essential and Alan was flexible throughout the weekend adjusting the timetable so that we got the most out of the time we were in Northumbria. Restaurant on the Friday night was a good choice, nice food, also the fish and chip shop on the Friday excellent and good prices.  Not so good - hotel looked very nice from the pictures, but hygiene was a big issue for me, mouldy bath mat which got changed once I asked, and there was mould on the shower panel it is in need of refurbishment, bedroom furniture MFI quite flimsy.  I understand why Alan has selected it as it was conveniently located but they do need to address  these issues I am sure he will feed back to them as its in an ideal location."",

It was extremely well organised, with a detailed itinerary which covered a huge range of locations to suit all tastes. His knowledge of the locations and where to get the best shots was excellent. The itinerary was adjusted according to the changes in weather and worked brilliantly. There was opportunity to try new techniques and creative styles with tuition or you can just do what you normally do in a beautiful place.  There were plenty of loo stops, a great B&B and some fantastic places to eat. I valued Alan's direct feedback and guidance, but he won't mince his words and will be honest and clear! Alan was always available for input but his style is not to be in your face, which our group appreciated. He is extremely knowledgable and skilled but is able to pitch things at the right level for the range of skill across the group. His good humour made the weekend great fun for all. Thanks"",

Was great to be able let Alan do the driving so we could relax between venues and concentrate on taking pictures. Felt Alan got the balance slightly wrong on first day between leaving us to our own devices without being invasive and perhaps offering more advice/help but given his 5 hour drive and the fact all three of us said we had at least 20 years of experience I wasn’t too bothered. Alan was very informative and helpful on 2nd and 3rd day with technical and artistic advice. Great locations and his knowledge of the area was very helpful in achieving some really good results which he was very helpful at dinner in giving advice on. Hands on advice of camera features and technical ideas really improved my results over the 3 days combined with being able to look through Alan’s camera at his framing and his final results at the various locations. Great choice of accommodation too with enjoyable meals to start and finish the days with chance to talk through the day and plan the next.   Will definitely be going on another workshop with Alan."",

The details about where/what we photographing were excellent and included weather forecast, tide times as well. We covered lots of locations over the 3 days. Got lots of really good tuition and loved the feedback sessions (on the days photos) in the evenings as it was dark early. A good group with same interest in learning more. One of my photos was also selected for this months banner on Alan's facebook group. Highly recommend to other photographers as it really gets you into the 'zone' to improve your skills.

I came away having learned a lot about the process of taking photographs, both in the technical sense but also in the sense of understanding the mental process to go through to see past the obvious and consider composition as well as deconstructing why it could go wrong to make it better.  A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me."",

      ""reviewBody"": ""The two day workshop held in the Lakes ticked all the boxes for photo techniques and more importantly for me offered an introduction to composition. I have enjoyed my photography for many years but knew that I need to understand the art rather than the technical side of image making. Alan was able to introduce the art side whilst relating to the technical so a win win situation for me. I am now looking forward to improving my compositional skills alongside Alan over the coming twelve months. A great weekend photo experience that i would recommend to others."",

Alan's tutoring touch was light but accurately placed so that so that we (a group of 3 plus Alan) had ample time to  understand and put into practice his advice without feeling pressured. Locations were chosen with our input to suite the changing weather conditions of early February. Alan is certainly knowledgeable and  passionate about photography and passes that on with humour and patience."",

A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me."",

Some decent locations and I felt Alan a struck a good balance between tuition and friendly travel companion ; undoubtedly a very competent tutor and I've picked up quite a bit personally. The midges and full-on sunlight were minor negatives, but that's the nature of these trips. Decent overnight accommodation and adequate meals etc. Very pleased with the experience and will look to participate again."",

I came away having learned a lot about the process of taking photographs, both in the technical sense but also in the sense of understanding the mental process to go through to see past the obvious and consider composition as well as deconstructing why it could go wrong to make it better.  A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me."",
