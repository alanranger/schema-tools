His expertise and constructive critique during the first session enabled him to tailor a session suitable for me for No 2. We discussed black and white photography and concentrated on editing some of my previous shots using software add-ons to the Lightroom program, which I already use. While I am by no means anywhere near expert quality, Alans teaching style has given me the confidence to take my photography to the next level. Alan offers as many 1-2-1 sessions as you feel you will need, but for me, I have chosen to use my other 2 sessions in a workshop situation, allowing me to get out and about with other photographers in the field and learn more techniques with guidance from Alan. One real positive that has come from this was an immediate solution to a problem I had been suffering with my photo editing. This was due to Lightroom being updated recently and my Mac not being able to cope. Since upgrading my RAM, following Alans recommendation, the performance and speed of my software has been much improved, allowing my to spend more time doing decent edits instead of waiting like I was before.

Not surprisingly, the theme of the workshop was 'Autumn leaves', and Alan started by stressing the importance of composition:no matter how expensive your kit or how technically skilled you are, these are of little value if what's in the frame is not interesting. After giving us some advice and a short demonstration he sent us off for half an hour to select our subject matter.  He then provided each of us with hands on guidance on how to take the best shots from both an artistic and technical point of view.  For example, he showed me some tricks available in my camera that I didn't know existed, and I'd never realized just how beautiful an oak leaf can be. In a few hours I learned a lot about photography in general and my camera's features in particular. For me, a very successful and inspiring day.",2018-10-11 14:36:00,,,,,
