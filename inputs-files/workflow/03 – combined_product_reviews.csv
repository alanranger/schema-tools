Spent a great productive and enjoyable 3 days on this workshop with Alan. Was great to be able let Alan do the driving so we could relax between venues and concentrate on taking pictures. Felt Alan got the balance slightly wrong on first day between leaving us to our own devices without being invasive and perhaps offering more advice/help but given his 5 hour drive and the fact all three of us said we had at least 20 years of experience I wasn’t too bothered. Alan was very informative and helpful on 2nd and 3rd day with technical and artistic advice. Great locations and his knowledge of the area was very helpful in achieving some really good results which he was very helpful at dinner in giving advice on. Hands on advice of camera features and technical ideas really improved my results over the 3 days combined with being able to look through Alan’s camera at his framing and his final results at the various locations. Great choice of accommodation too with enjoyable meals to start and finish the days with chance to talk through the day and plan the next.   Will definitely be going on another workshop with Alan.,4.0,Organic,Thanks Justin.

I was therefore a bit cautious about booking this one in case it was similar. It couldn't have been more different.  I recently completed the 'Get Off Auto' course as a taster session and found this to be excellent. Alan covers everything you need to known in a 2.5 hour session and rather than sending you out blindly to take photo's - these are given as exercises to complete in your own time - meaning you have more time to explore each topic and ask the questions that you really want to ask.

Landscape Photography DEVON Workshops - Various Dates,landscape-photography-devon-hartland-quay,Bassam Al Jazy,5.0,"I recently attended the Landscape Photography Devon Workshop with Mr. Alan Ranger, and it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. The workshop was well-organized, with a detailed schedule and excellent information about each location — including the best times for sunrise, sunset, high tide, and low tide. Everything we needed to know was clearly explained and thoughtfully planned.  The choice of locations was perfect for training and practice. Each spot offered unique opportunities to experiment with composition, light, and timing. I must admit, I learned a lot of useful techniques, creative ideas, and ways to think differently about each shot — especially the importance of being patient and waiting for the right moment.  There were only three of us in total, which made the experience even more personal and interactive. I also learned a great deal from my fellow participants. The commuting distances between locations were short and comfortable, and Alan proved to be not only an excellent tutor but also an excellent driver!  Overall, this workshop was both educational and inspiring.

His expertise and constructive critique during the first session enabled him to tailor a session suitable for me for No 2. We discussed black and white photography and concentrated on editing some of my previous shots using software add-ons to the Lightroom program, which I already use. While I am by no means anywhere near expert quality, Alans teaching style has given me the confidence to take my photography to the next level. Alan offers as many 1-2-1 sessions as you feel you will need, but for me, I have chosen to use my other 2 sessions in a workshop situation, allowing me to get out and about with other photographers in the field and learn more techniques with guidance from Alan. One real positive that has come from this was an immediate solution to a problem I had been suffering with my photo editing. This was due to Lightroom being updated recently and my Mac not being able to cope. Since upgrading my RAM, following Alans recommendation, the performance and speed of my software has been much improved, allowing my to spend more time doing decent edits instead of waiting like I was before. Many thanks for all your help so far, and looking forward to the next one.",5.0,FileUploadInvitation,,en,https://www.alanranger.com/,Alan Ranger Photography,5438f8a600006400057adbb4,,,,,1-2-1 sessions - An absolute godsend.

The information that Alan provided in advance was very comprehensive, and included not just equipment required but also advice on clothing and food and drink. Not surprisingly, the theme of the workshop was 'Autumn leaves', and Alan started by stressing the importance of composition:no matter how expensive your kit or how technically skilled you are, these are of little value if what's in the frame is not interesting. After giving us some advice and a short demonstration he sent us off for half an hour to select our subject matter.  He then provided each of us with hands on guidance on how to take the best shots from both an artistic and technical point of view.  For example, he showed me some tricks available in my camera that I didn't know existed, and I'd never realized just how beautiful an oak leaf can be. In a few hours I learned a lot about photography in general and my camera's features in particular.

I love it, but have no idea how to use all the settings to get the best out of it, so after seeing the 'photography made easy' course online, I decided to book onto it.

Although it's not practical, it is really interactive and Alan encourages lots of participation, questions, thoughts etc. The course covers the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO etc. necessary for you to go home and experiment, knowing what all the settings on the camera dial are. Alan was very patient and didn't mind explaining numerous times what certain things are when the class for confused!

So, with not much preparation other than the informative email from Alan, off I drove to the Kenilworth session, not knowing quite what to expect. The venue was good, parking well lit and room was more than adequate. You would think that 3 hours of listening and trying to understand the very basics of photography would drag,  but actually the time went fast. Alan was knowledgeable, keen to impart that knowledge,  and all 11 of us in the room made some small or large contribution to the evening. I have come away knowing a lot more than I knew when I started, and am looking forward to recharging those camera batteries to take photographs  (not snaps!) that have been created, not snapped with hopefulness!  As a stand alone evening this was a great start. There is the opportunity to continue on the 5 week course at a discounted rate if booked on the evening, however my personal feeling was that I would prefer to start practicing with my Bridge camera before committing a further  £175 (£200 if booked after the easy photography evening).

One of my photos was also selected for this months banner on Alan's facebook group. Highly recommend to other photographers as it really gets you into the 'zone' to improve your skills.

I was not upset about the cancellation as the reason was due to a change in conditions and the I was pleased it didn't go ahead when there would be nothing to photograph.  It then took many attempts to find a date that worked for myself and for Alan.    The details for joining the workshop came a couple of days before the event.  It did recommend a filter that I didn't have but it was too late to buy it from Amazon.  No real problem through as we did really need it.  The first 15 minutes of the workshop were tuition and I picked up a few very useful tips from the workshop which I will use in future.  The rest of the workshop is you photograph the subject and move around the site at your own pace but not too far from the group so Alan can move around each individual and answer questions, review photos and give advice.  You are expected to ask questions and learn more that way.  I personally find that I don't think of questions until much later when the learning experience has really soaked in.  So it would have been good to stop and specifically talk about a topic.    I plan to visit the location again on a different day and try again now I have seen my photos.

I had attended a prior 1-day course with another company, and so my expectations were set around what I had experienced. However, after attending this course I was truly blown away.  Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.

Had a great day and came away with many new skills and ideas, which I feel will give me something to think about, build on and improve my photography. Only 4 of us, so a nice small group with plenty of one to one tuition as needed.  A lot of emphasis was placed on observation and carefully choosing and thinking about what a shot should show and say, and trying to develop an eye for an interesting picture (Rather than just point and click); we experimented with taking shots for colour, landscape vistas, and close up macro photography of leaves, flowers, and fungi.    I also learnt a lot more about what my camera can do in terms of settings, exposures, focusing and light metering. I thought I knew my camera fairly well, but now can get so much more out of it.  In conclusion;  a fabulous day, with good company in a beautiful location, and I would have no hesitation in recommending.",5.0,Organic,,en,https://www.alanranger.com/,Alan Ranger Photography,5438f8a600006400057adbb4,,,,,A fantastic day workshop.
