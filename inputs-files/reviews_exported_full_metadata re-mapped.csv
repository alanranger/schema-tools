Mr Glyn Fletcher,03/04/2018 13:47,Photographic Short Break to Northumbria could be so much better,"It seems to me Alan may be more comfortable in a classroom than on location this time to Northumbria. Their was little or no preparation on the scene we were about to visit. What we will see, what we could be looking for to frame a shot, alternative viewpoints, what obvious mistakes to avoid. How to set up the camera, which lens, mode, exposure depth of field etc and whether there were any questions on reaching our destination. Instead on arrival Alan marched us straight to where he thought the best image was with no discussion, set up his camera and really had little by way of Q & A on site leaving everyone to pretty much get on with it. He reviewed the images captured over the evening meal and made comments by which time it was of course too late to consider changing composition or camera settings. This is learning by ones mistakes after the photographic opportunity has passed and not taking advantage of a professionals knowledge to consider how to improve whilst the opportunity is in front of you. I did ask the others on our trip how they thought the trip was going and I agreed with much of their comments which I have repeated here. I have resisted reviewing Alans trip since October 2017 as I think he believes he is doing a good job and will not be receptive to negative comments.",3,Trustpilot,Alan Ranger Photography,Alan Ranger Photography

Bean counter,10/11/2018 14:36,Workshop at Batsford Arboretum,"I recently attended one of Alan's workshops at Batsford Arboretum. The information that Alan provided in advance was very comprehensive, and included not just equipment required but also advice on clothing and food and drink. Not surprisingly, the theme of the workshop was 'Autumn leaves', and Alan started by stressing the importance of composition:no matter how expensive your kit or how technically skilled you are, these are of little value if what's in the frame is not interesting. After giving us some advice and a short demonstration he sent us off for half an hour to select our subject matter.  He then provided each of us with hands on guidance on how to take the best shots from both an artistic and technical point of view.  For example, he showed me some tricks available in my camera that I didn't know existed, and I'd never realized just how beautiful an oak leaf can be. In a few hours I learned a lot about photography in general and my camera's features in particular. For me, a very successful and inspiring day.",4,Trustpilot,Autumn Photography Workshop,Batsford Autumn Workshop

Had a great day and came away with many new skills and ideas, which I feel will give me something to think about, build on and improve my photography. Only 4 of us, so a nice small group with plenty of one to one tuition as needed.  A lot of emphasis was placed on observation and carefully choosing and thinking about what a shot should show and say, and trying to develop an eye for an interesting picture (Rather than just point and click); we experimented with taking shots for colour, landscape vistas, and close up macro photography of leaves, flowers, and fungi.    I also learnt a lot more about what my camera can do in terms of settings, exposures, focusing and light metering. I thought I knew my camera fairly well, but now can get so much more out of it.  In conclusion;  a fabulous day, with good company in a beautiful location, and I would have no hesitation in recommending.",5,Trustpilot,nan,Batsford Autumn Workshop

Alan is a brilliant teacher who explains things clearly and in an easy-to-understand way. He takes the time to make sure everyone understands and is happy to go over things again and again. The weekly assignments are fun and challenge you to think differently about your photography. Having the feedback for your images both educational and a boost in confidence. Can't put a price on what this course has taught me. Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level. But I learned more about the technical side of photography in the last 5 weeks than I did in all that previous time.

Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.

Gillian Perry,05/09/2018 07:42,Good Workshop and I gained a few good tips,"I saw an advert for a workshop I really wanted to do that was cancelled.  I was not upset about the cancellation as the reason was due to a change in conditions and the I was pleased it didn't go ahead when there would be nothing to photograph.  It then took many attempts to find a date that worked for myself and for Alan.    The details for joining the workshop came a couple of days before the event.  It did recommend a filter that I didn't have but it was too late to buy it from Amazon.  No real problem through as we did really need it.  The first 15 minutes of the workshop were tuition and I picked up a few very useful tips from the workshop which I will use in future.  The rest of the workshop is you photograph the subject and move around the site at your own pace but not too far from the group so Alan can move around each individual and answer questions, review photos and give advice.  You are expected to ask questions and learn more that way.  I personally find that I don't think of questions until much later when the learning experience has really soaked in.  So it would have been good to stop and specifically talk about a topic.    I plan to visit the location again on a different day and try again now I have seen my photos.

He told us at the beginning of the day long session it was up to us to go and take photographs and then he would circulate and look at our results.  He then proceeded to wander off with his own camera and click away to his own benefit.  Yes he did come over to me once all day and went through my photos.

James L,23/04/2019 18:38,Get Off Auto is an Excellent Intro to your DSLR,I have attended a couple of DSLR introduction courses in the past and have both were not particularly good. Mostly a brief overview of the non-automatic modes and then you're sent out to take pictures. What this means is you don't really learn anything. I was therefore a bit cautious about booking this one in case it was similar. It couldn't have been more different.  I recently completed the 'Get Off Auto' course as a taster session and found this to be excellent. Alan covers everything you need to known in a 2.5 hour session and rather than sending you out blindly to take photo's - these are given as exercises to complete in your own time - meaning you have more time to explore each topic and ask the questions that you really want to ask.   The first week introduction is a good starter and is the natural lead in to the 4 week beginners course.,5,Trustpilot,Get Off Auto Class,Get Off Auto Class

Rachel Sutton,21/02/2016 11:14,Informative,I used a groupon offer for a 3hr beginners course in photography which focus's on the theoretical aspect of taking a photo. Alan was welcoming and engaging throughout. The content was set at a good level to not get too bogged down but provide as much information as reasonable in the 3 hours.

Jill Groves,15/01/2016 09:21,A must to get the most out of your DSLR camera.,"A great course that makes having a DSLR camera worthwhile. Without the knowledge I learnt on Alan's course I might as well own just a compact point and shoot camera.

Looking forward to putting the theory into practice now! Thank you",4,Trustpilot,nan,Get Off Auto Class
Robert Edwards,15/01/2016 08:34,Fascinating insight into how more meaningful photos can be produced,"Very thought provoking introduction. As Alan discussed each topic I could readily link the content to specific photos I have been both happy and disappointed with in the past, without really knowing why.

Clinton Rindfuss,09/01/2016 10:58,Highly informative evening.,I wanted to learn some of the basics of photography in terms of the technicalities. I came away with much more than that....

Chantal Garman,08/01/2016 15:25,Learnt so much in 3 hours!,"I've wanted a 'proper' camera (ie. A DSLR) for a long time and I got one for Christmas. I love it, but have no idea how to use all the settings to get the best out of it, so after seeing the 'photography made easy' course online, I decided to book onto it.     I found out after booking that the course was a 'lecture' format so I was a bit skeptical, thinking that I probably wouldn't learn a whole lot. I was completely wrong! Although it's not practical, it is really interactive and Alan encourages lots of participation, questions, thoughts etc. The course covers the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO etc. necessary for you to go home and experiment, knowing what all the settings on the camera dial are. Alan was very patient and didn't mind explaining numerous times what certain things are when the class for confused!    I enjoyed the course very much and I have now signed up to the extended course, because I believe I will greatly benefit from doing practical work with Alan. Thank you very much!",5,Trustpilot,nan,Get Off Auto Class
Janice Jordan,08/01/2016 14:10,Something for everyone,"I joined one of Alan's groups as a complete beginner, not even knowing I could take my camera off auto settings.

I would recommend Alan to any level of photographer, he really does have something to offer everyone who wants to learn more.",5,Trustpilot,nan,Get Off Auto Class
Kate Tait,08/01/2016 09:39,Well organised and informative,"""3 hours of beginners photography"", my husband said was my Christmas present. So, with not much preparation other than the informative email from Alan, off I drove to the Kenilworth session, not knowing quite what to expect. The venue was good, parking well lit and room was more than adequate. You would think that 3 hours of listening and trying to understand the very basics of photography would drag,  but actually the time went fast. Alan was knowledgeable, keen to impart that knowledge,  and all 11 of us in the room made some small or large contribution to the evening. I have come away knowing a lot more than I knew when I started, and am looking forward to recharging those camera batteries to take photographs  (not snaps!) that have been created, not snapped with hopefulness!  As a stand alone evening this was a great start. There is the opportunity to continue on the 5 week course at a discounted rate if booked on the evening, however my personal feeling was that I would prefer to start practicing with my Bridge camera before committing a further  Â£175 (Â£200 if booked after the easy photography evening). Thanks Alan for teaching the basics.",4,Trustpilot,nan,Get Off Auto Class
Martin Chidgey,08/01/2016 08:33,"Enjoyable, informative and educational!",Alan's obvious enthusiasm and creativity made for a really interesting and informative evening.

The course has made me keen to go out with my camera, use the settings, think about what I'm doing and try to take photographs I'm proud to show others rather than leave them stored on my computer.

Personally I like a 'hands-on' style of learning which is why I am following up with Alan - it's really hard to get that experience in a beginners session when some people haven't really played with anything other than the full auto settings (me!) and others know a bit more...so I felt that this was pitched right, well worth the money, and has inspired me to do more - which was exactly what I wanted!",5,Trustpilot,nan,Get Off Auto Class

With some basic knowledge of settings and controls I was hoping for a refresher and but most of the course was very abstract, about a photograph having to say something about the photographer. Only the last 45 minutes was actual techniques and settings, so it was very basic. It felt a bit like it was intended to draw you in to sign up for the four week course rather than a course in its own right.",2,Trustpilot,nan,Get Off Auto Class
Ally Darrall,29/08/2015 09:52,3hr Photography Made Easy Course,The session was great. It was an eye opener and one which I thoroughly enjoyed. Learning the fundamental issues of the cameras that are around and problems which can occur should various settings be applied to ones camera. But you can overcome these such problems with practice. All I now need to do is concentrate on my own application of developing myself and my way of shooting.

Dave Ackers,27/08/2015 08:28,Photography is not a Black (or White) Art,Alan was able to get across the foundations of photography through illustrations and clear to understand explanations.

There is lots of theory that really helps build the foundation before you can start to put that into practice.   I found Alan really high energy and passionate about photography, which meant I came away feeling like I'd learnt a lot and excited about using my new knowledge.

There is little point in knowing all the settings on my camera if I do not see at what is around me and create photographs that share with others what I feel about what I see.

Alan was very informative and helpful on 2nd and 3rd day with technical and artistic advice. Great locations and his knowledge of the area was very helpful in achieving some really good results which he was very helpful at dinner in giving advice on. Hands on advice of camera features and technical ideas really improved my results over the 3 days combined with being able to look through Alanâ€™s camera at his framing and his final results at the various locations. Great choice of accommodation too with enjoyable meals to start and finish the days with chance to talk through the day and plan the next.

Restaurant on the Friday night was a good choice, nice food, also the fish and chip shop on the Friday excellent and good prices.

Ester  Riodran,19/10/2019 16:20,Review of Northumbria Photo Trip,"Good points - weather was fantastic, tuition good but you do need to ask Alan for help which I don't have a problem with.  Some fantastic areas to photograph.  We went to various locations so that everyone could get something including a lovely sun rise in Craster so time management was essential and Alan was flexible throughout the weekend adjusting the timetable so that we got the most out of the time we were in Northumbria. Restaurant on the Friday night was a good choice, nice food, also the fish and chip shop on the Friday excellent and good prices.

I came away having learned a lot about the process of taking photographs, both in the technical sense but also in the sense of understanding the mental process to go through to see past the obvious and consider composition as well as deconstructing why it could go wrong to make it better.

David McGuire,12/12/2019 10:26,1-2-1 sessions - An absolute godsend.,"After completing the beginners course, I wasn't sure what do do next, so I signed up for some 1-2-1 sessions with Alan. His expertise and constructive critique during the first session enabled him to tailor a session suitable for me for No 2. We discussed black and white photography and concentrated on editing some of my previous shots using software add-ons to the Lightroom program, which I already use. While I am by no means anywhere near expert quality, Alans teaching style has given me the confidence to take my photography to the next level. Alan offers as many 1-2-1 sessions as you feel you will need, but for me, I have chosen to use my other 2 sessions in a workshop situation, allowing me to get out and about with other photographers in the field and learn more techniques with guidance from Alan. One real positive that has come from this was an immediate solution to a problem I had been suffering with my photo editing. This was due to Lightroom being updated recently and my Mac not being able to cope. Since upgrading my RAM, following Alans recommendation, the performance and speed of my software has been much improved, allowing my to spend more time doing decent edits instead of waiting like I was before.

Only areas of improvement I would have like to have seen were:  - More free resources to take home i.e. presentation slides, website links for further information  - More practical exercises preferably outside  - More guidance preperation beforehand - for me it was knowing the slides would not be available so bringing the relevant material along to the tuition.",4,Trustpilot,nan,Private Tuition

We were luckier with the weather than was expected, which was a bonus!  I accept that the event is not costly and isnâ€™t tuition-based but Iâ€™m not sure we gained a lot from what we could have done ourselves. However, this may have been partly our fault as we were a small group and may not have engaged with the photography as much as we could have done.  We lost Alan in the latter part of the walk as people splintered off to take the photographs they wanted - many of those who sign up to his outdoor events I feel are seasoned photographers.  It was stated we could ask for help but I would suggest that a way to make an improvement for less experienced photographers would be for him to make a few proactive suggestions as to suitable apertures etc at the start of the walk which would make people feel they had gained something above what they could do on their own. It would also encourage them to go again.

Alan took us to brilliant locations and made sure everyone was comfortable with both the creative aspect of 'seeing the shot' and then attempting to execute it but fortunately stopped short of taking the shot for us to ensure we really learned from the experience. The evening feedback sessions reviewing our shots enabled us to modify technique on the subsequent days to improve the quality of our images.  He also helped me use Christmas presents like Expodisc to great effect and navigate the menus of my new Sony camera.  The domestic arrangements were also very good with friendly staff who were not fazed by a group of photopapers with muddy boots.,5,Trustpilot,nan,Woodland Photowalk
Stuart Mitchell,05/01/2015 22:20,Warwickshire Photowalk - 29/12/14,"A pleasant experience walking around the Warwickshire countryside near Lapworth on this crisp winters day. Interesting seeing Alan at work but also giving varied advice to his ""followers"" of which there was five.  It's interesting seeing how many photographic opportunities there are just taking a casual stroll around the countryside - to which Alan pointed out several times during our 4.5 mile ""stroll"" which was broken with lunch at the Punchbowl to refuel - very nice!  All round pleasant experience (really Alan!)  Look forward to the next workshop.    Stuart Mitchell",5,Trustpilot,nan,Woodland Photowalk
