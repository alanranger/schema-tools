Robert Griffiths,"Despite absolutely appalling weather, I had an amazing weekend at Hartland Quay and its environs with Alan. His enthusiasm to capture images and learn photography in the most challenging conditions was infectious.   If we were unable to venture outside, we spent our time learning some extremely useful methods in Lightroom & Photoshop together with a variety of other software packages.  I would highly recommend Alan if you are wanting to not only have a great experience in stunning scenery on his workshops, but also in the classroom to improve your photography beyond expectation. You won't be disappointed.  Thank you Alan",5,Devon Costal Workshop,07/03/2020 11:59,Trustpilot

Nuria Alonso,"I have done a couple of courses and workshops with Alan. They are always packed with knowledge and tips. Whether you are a beginner like me or a more advance photographer you will learn loads  with Alan. I really like the emails he sends before the class/workshop full of information (I.e. location, map, what to wear, what accessories you need...) so you know exactly what to expect.",5,Beginners Photography Course,13/12/2019 09:36,Trustpilot
David McGuire,"After completing the beginners course, I wasn't sure what do do next, so I signed up for some 1-2-1 sessions with Alan. His expertise and constructive critique during the first session enabled him to tailor a session suitable for me for No 2. We discussed black and white photography and concentrated on editing some of my previous shots using software add-ons to the Lightroom program, which I already use. While I am by no means anywhere near expert quality, Alans teaching style has given me the confidence to take my photography to the next level. Alan offers as many 1-2-1 sessions as you feel you will need, but for me, I have chosen to use my other 2 sessions in a workshop situation, allowing me to get out and about with other photographers in the field and learn more techniques with guidance from Alan. One real positive that has come from this was an immediate solution to a problem I had been suffering with my photo editing. This was due to Lightroom being updated recently and my Mac not being able to cope. Since upgrading my RAM, following Alans recommendation, the performance and speed of my software has been much improved, allowing my to spend more time doing decent edits instead of waiting like I was before. Many thanks for all your help so far, and looking forward to the next one.",5,Private Tuition,12/12/2019 10:26,Trustpilot

D Jeffrey,Just returned from an excellent workshop in the Lake District.  Alan took us to brilliant locations and made sure everyone was comfortable with both the creative aspect of 'seeing the shot' and then attempting to execute it but fortunately stopped short of taking the shot for us to ensure we really learned from the experience. The evening feedback sessions reviewing our shots enabled us to modify technique on the subsequent days to improve the quality of our images.  He also helped me use Christmas presents like Expodisc to great effect and navigate the menus of my new Sony camera.  The domestic arrangements were also very good with friendly staff who were not fazed by a group of photopapers with muddy boots.,5,Woodland Photowalk,16/11/2019 10:11,Trustpilot
Andrew Reynolds,"I had a very enjoyable three day photography trip with Alan Ranger in the Lake District staying near Keswick.  Alan drove us to some fantastic locations that I would never have found on my own. He showed us example photographs he had previously taken in the areas we visited to give us ideas for compositions. He was happy to help with any questions or advice you need, but you need to ask for help if you want it, otherwise he will leave you alone to do what you want; which suited me.  I have come back with more good photographs from one weekend trip than I would normally manage to get in a year.",5,Lake District Workshop,14/11/2019 15:04,Trustpilot
Justin Meaden,"Had a very enjoyable long weekend in the Lake District with Alan Ranger Photography. Great Worksop itinerary provided beforehand with helpful photos and locations. Alan provided fantastic advice and guidance throughout the workshop both technically and composition wise and provided a range of potential types of subjects.

After a few hours of practising and asking Alan for advice how to improve shots, the results started to improve and by the end of the day I have some very pleasing pictures. Batsford Arboretum was a great location for this type of photography and there was more than enough subject matter to shoot; both macro and wide landscapes.

Ester  Riodran,"Good points - weather was fantastic, tuition good but you do need to ask Alan for help which I don't have a problem with.  Some fantastic areas to photograph.  We went to various locations so that everyone could get something including a lovely sun rise in Craster so time management was essential and Alan was flexible throughout the weekend adjusting the timetable so that we got the most out of the time we were in Northumbria. Restaurant on the Friday night was a good choice, nice food, also the fish and chip shop on the Friday excellent and good prices.  Not so good - hotel looked very nice from the pictures, but hygiene was a big issue for me, mouldy bath mat which got changed once I asked, and there was mould on the shower panel it is in need of refurbishment, bedroom furniture MFI quite flimsy.  I understand why Alan has selected it as it was conveniently located but they do need to address  these issues I am sure he will feed back to them as its in an ideal location.",4,Northumbria Coastal Workshop,19/10/2019 16:20,Trustpilot

Dr James Parker,"I attended one of Alan's 3 day all inclusive trips to Norfolk this September. It was extremely well organised, with a detailed itinerary which covered a huge range of locations to suit all tastes. His knowledge of the locations and where to get the best shots was excellent. The itinerary was adjusted according to the changes in weather and worked brilliantly. There was opportunity to try new techniques and creative styles with tuition or you can just do what you normally do in a beautiful place.  There were plenty of loo stops, a great B&B and some fantastic places to eat. I valued Alan's direct feedback and guidance, but he won't mince his words and will be honest and clear! Alan was always available for input but his style is not to be in your face, which our group appreciated. He is extremely knowledgable and skilled but is able to pitch things at the right level for the range of skill across the group. His good humour made the weekend great fun for all.

Wendy Anthony,"This â€˜walking in the woodsâ€™ experience is a good idea and we enjoyed it. We were luckier with the weather than was expected, which was a bonus!  I accept that the event is not costly and isnâ€™t tuition-based but Iâ€™m not sure we gained a lot from what we could have done ourselves. However, this may have been partly our fault as we were a small group and may not have engaged with the photography as much as we could have done.  We lost Alan in the latter part of the walk as people splintered off to take the photographs they wanted - many of those who sign up to his outdoor events I feel are seasoned photographers.  It was stated we could ask for help but I would suggest that a way to make an improvement for less experienced photographers would be for him to make a few proactive suggestions as to suitable apertures etc at the start of the walk which would make people feel they had gained something above what they could do on their own. It would also encourage them to go again. We do hope to come on another walk at some time in the future though and I would look forward to my results being rather better!",3,Woodland Photowalk,07/05/2019 22:47,Trustpilot

James L,I have attended a couple of DSLR introduction courses in the past and have both were not particularly good. Mostly a brief overview of the non-automatic modes and then you're sent out to take pictures. What this means is you don't really learn anything. I was therefore a bit cautious about booking this one in case it was similar. It couldn't have been more different.  I recently completed the 'Get Off Auto' course as a taster session and found this to be excellent. Alan covers everything you need to known in a 2.5 hour session and rather than sending you out blindly to take photo's - these are given as exercises to complete in your own time - meaning you have more time to explore each topic and ask the questions that you really want to ask.   The first week introduction is a good starter and is the natural lead in to the 4 week beginners course.,5,Get Off Auto Class,23/04/2019 18:38,Trustpilot

Bean counter,"I recently attended one of Alan's workshops at Batsford Arboretum. The information that Alan provided in advance was very comprehensive, and included not just equipment required but also advice on clothing and food and drink. Not surprisingly, the theme of the workshop was 'Autumn leaves', and Alan started by stressing the importance of composition:no matter how expensive your kit or how technically skilled you are, these are of little value if what's in the frame is not interesting. After giving us some advice and a short demonstration he sent us off for half an hour to select our subject matter.  He then provided each of us with hands on guidance on how to take the best shots from both an artistic and technical point of view.  For example, he showed me some tricks available in my camera that I didn't know existed, and I'd never realized just how beautiful an oak leaf can be. In a few hours I learned a lot about photography in general and my camera's features in particular. For me, a very successful and inspiring day.",4,Batsford Autumn Workshop,10/11/2018 14:36,Trustpilot

I've done a couple of photography workshops now, but this was the first with Alan Ranger.

Joyce James,"Just back from a 3 day workshop with Alan up in Northumberland - this was the latest of many workshops I have attended plus other mentoring sessions including 1:1 tuition. I always enjoy my time on workshops etc but this one was particular memorable  as Alan cleverly maximised the opportunities presented by the challenging weather conditions (wild and windy). I learned lots about making the most of the conditions and used quite advanced photography techniques - for example, long exposures, bracketing and taking more than one shot to subsequently 'mask' in photoshop. Great too to be out in the environment instead of huddled indoors!",5,Northumbria Coastal Workshop,16/10/2018 13:09,Trustpilot

Gillian Perry,"I saw an advert for a workshop I really wanted to do that was cancelled.  I was not upset about the cancellation as the reason was due to a change in conditions and the I was pleased it didn't go ahead when there would be nothing to photograph.  It then took many attempts to find a date that worked for myself and for Alan.    The details for joining the workshop came a couple of days before the event.  It did recommend a filter that I didn't have but it was too late to buy it from Amazon.  No real problem through as we did really need it.  The first 15 minutes of the workshop were tuition and I picked up a few very useful tips from the workshop which I will use in future.  The rest of the workshop is you photograph the subject and move around the site at your own pace but not too far from the group so Alan can move around each individual and answer questions, review photos and give advice.  You are expected to ask questions and learn more that way.  I personally find that I don't think of questions until much later when the learning experience has really soaked in.  So it would have been good to stop and specifically talk about a topic.    I plan to visit the location again on a different day and try again now I have seen my photos.  I will definitely consider booking again in the future depending on the subjects.",4,Chesterton Windmill Workshop,05/09/2018 07:42,Trustpilot

Barbara Skeet,"Mr Ranger took my camera off me athe beginning of my paid session and altered all my settings, even my view finder was altered to his eye.  It took me several weeks to reset my camera to my settings! The session itself was of little benefit to me, as he was more interested in three other members of the group who obviously were impressed with his constant name dropping of where his photographs had appeared.  He told us at the beginning of the day long session it was up to us to go and take photographs and then he would circulate and look at our results.  He then proceeded to wander off with his own camera and click away to his own benefit.  Yes he did come over to me once all day and went through my photos.  I found his comments unhelpful, but I guess by this time I had realised that this course and tutor was not for me.  The day could not end soon enough for me.

Mr Glyn Fletcher,"It seems to me Alan may be more comfortable in a classroom than on location this time to Northumbria. Their was little or no preparation on the scene we were about to visit. What we will see, what we could be looking for to frame a shot, alternative viewpoints, what obvious mistakes to avoid. How to set up the camera, which lens, mode, exposure depth of field etc and whether there were any questions on reaching our destination. Instead on arrival Alan marched us straight to where he thought the best image was with no discussion, set up his camera and really had little by way of Q & A on site leaving everyone to pretty much get on with it. He reviewed the images captured over the evening meal and made comments by which time it was of course too late to consider changing composition or camera settings. This is learning by ones mistakes after the photographic opportunity has passed and not taking advantage of a professionals knowledge to consider how to improve whilst the opportunity is in front of you. I did ask the others on our trip how they thought the trip was going and I agreed with much of their comments which I have repeated here. I have resisted reviewing Alans trip since October 2017 as I think he believes he is doing a good job and will not be receptive to negative comments.",3,Alan Ranger Photography,03/04/2018 13:47,Trustpilot
Elaine,"I really enjoyed the day out with Alan at Batsford Arboretum. It was very relaxed and friendly and Alan made time to speak to each individual and see how they were getting along, giving constructive advice and criticism.

I already had some experience of the techniques of manually operating a camera from a long time ago (pre-digital) and this was an excellent refresher in the ""digital age"" with some real nuggets of advice on both the technical aspects of exposure and improving your creativity around picture composition.

I understand the 4 week add on course has a more practical approach however for people like me who need to be 'hands on' to reinforce  understanding I do feel that it would be useful to incorporate a practical element throughout.",4,Get Off Auto Class,27/02/2018 18:02,Trustpilot

He is continuous in his sharing of knowledge, tips and skills in order to ensure that you develop your image taking abilities. He is also honest in his comments and will not hesitate to point out things that are wrong - maybe things that other photographers havn't mentioned but at the end of the day we all learn from our mistakes perhaps more than our successes.

Justin Meaden,Northumbria castles and coastline! Spent a great productive and enjoyable 3 days on this workshop with Alan. Was great to be able let Alan do the driving so we could relax between venues and concentrate on taking pictures. Felt Alan got the balance slightly wrong on first day between leaving us to our own devices without being invasive and perhaps offering more advice/help but given his 5 hour drive and the fact all three of us said we had at least 20 years of experience I wasnâ€™t too bothered. Alan was very informative and helpful on 2nd and 3rd day with technical and artistic advice. Great locations and his knowledge of the area was very helpful in achieving some really good results which he was very helpful at dinner in giving advice on. Hands on advice of camera features and technical ideas really improved my results over the 3 days combined with being able to look through Alanâ€™s camera at his framing and his final results at the various locations. Great choice of accommodation too with enjoyable meals to start and finish the days with chance to talk through the day and plan the next.   Will definitely be going on another workshop with Alan.,4,Northumbria Coastal Workshop,27/10/2017 21:25,Trustpilot

Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level.

The details about where/what we photographing were excellent and included weather forecast, tide times as well. We covered lots of locations over the 3 days. Got lots of really good tuition and loved the feedback sessions (on the days photos) in the evenings as it was dark early. A good group with same interest in learning more. One of my photos was also selected for this months banner on Alan's facebook group. Highly recommend to other photographers as it really gets you into the 'zone' to improve your skills.

Amar Majid,"I enrolled onto the 4-week beginner's course with Alan, run from Kenilworth. I had attended a prior 1-day course with another company, and so my expectations were set around what I had experienced. However, after attending this course I was truly blown away.  Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.  There are flexible payment options available and I approached Alan initially to discuss my needs and he tailored a plan suitable for what I wanted to achieve.",5,Beginners Photography Course,04/12/2016 22:41,Trustpilot

Mr Clive Ansell,"I attended one of Alan's workshop at Batsford arboretum. Had a great day and came away with many new skills and ideas, which I feel will give me something to think about, build on and improve my photography. Only 4 of us, so a nice small group with plenty of one to one tuition as needed.  A lot of emphasis was placed on observation and carefully choosing and thinking about what a shot should show and say, and trying to develop an eye for an interesting picture (Rather than just point and click); we experimented with taking shots for colour, landscape vistas, and close up macro photography of leaves, flowers, and fungi.    I also learnt a lot more about what my camera can do in terms of settings, exposures, focusing and light metering. I thought I knew my camera fairly well, but now can get so much more out of it.  In conclusion;  a fabulous day, with good company in a beautiful location, and I would have no hesitation in recommending.",5,Batsford Autumn Workshop,03/11/2016 10:13,Trustpilot

I found out after booking that the course was a 'lecture' format so I was a bit skeptical, thinking that I probably wouldn't learn a whole lot. I was completely wrong! Although it's not practical, it is really interactive and Alan encourages lots of participation, questions, thoughts etc. The course covers the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO etc. necessary for you to go home and experiment, knowing what all the settings on the camera dial are. Alan was very patient and didn't mind explaining numerous times what certain things are when the class for confused!

Kate Tait,"""3 hours of beginners photography"", my husband said was my Christmas present. So, with not much preparation other than the informative email from Alan, off I drove to the Kenilworth session, not knowing quite what to expect. The venue was good, parking well lit and room was more than adequate. You would think that 3 hours of listening and trying to understand the very basics of photography would drag,  but actually the time went fast. Alan was knowledgeable, keen to impart that knowledge,  and all 11 of us in the room made some small or large contribution to the evening. I have come away knowing a lot more than I knew when I started, and am looking forward to recharging those camera batteries to take photographs  (not snaps!) that have been created, not snapped with hopefulness!  As a stand alone evening this was a great start. There is the opportunity to continue on the 5 week course at a discounted rate if booked on the evening, however my personal feeling was that I would prefer to start practicing with my Bridge camera before committing a further  Â£175 (Â£200 if booked after the easy photography evening). Thanks Alan for teaching the basics.",4,Get Off Auto Class,08/01/2016 09:39,Trustpilot

I came away having learned a lot about the process of taking photographs, both in the technical sense but also in the sense of understanding the mental process to go through to see past the obvious and consider composition as well as deconstructing why it could go wrong to make it better.  A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me.",5,Peak District Photography Workshop,09/03/2015 15:59,Trustpilot

Alans expertise and passion for photography really shone through. We covered mainly theory and introduction to using lightroom.       Only areas of improvement I would have like to have seen were:  - More free resources to take home i.e. presentation slides, website links for further information  - More practical exercises preferably outside  - More guidance preperation beforehand - for me it was knowing the slides would not be available so bringing the relevant material along to the tuition.",4,Private Tuition,05/03/2015 06:27,Trustpilot

From the start, Alan's friendly and patient approach made learning easy and his genuine critique of our work was 'firm but fair' so we had useful feedback. For me, a key thing he said was 'photographers take photographs, not cameras'. There is little point in knowing all the settings on my camera if I do not see at what is around me and create photographs that share with others what I feel about what I see.
