The weekend was planned really thoroughly to ensure we had a great selection of locations and spent a minimum amount of time in the car - although the agenda was flexible enough to move things around to suit conditions and the preferences of the group. Alan was always on hand to help with our pictures re settings, composition and equipment and would show is what he was doing as he was shooting as well. Accommodation and food stops all very good too. A thoroughly enjoyable weekend that has really helped with my photography",

It was extremely well organised, with a detailed itinerary which covered a huge range of locations to suit all tastes. His knowledge of the locations and where to get the best shots was excellent. The itinerary was adjusted according to the changes in weather and worked brilliantly. There was opportunity to try new techniques and creative styles with tuition or you can just do what you normally do in a beautiful place.  There were plenty of loo stops, a great B&B and some fantastic places to eat. I valued Alan's direct feedback and guidance, but he won't mince his words and will be honest and clear! Alan was always available for input but his style is not to be in your face, which our group appreciated. He is extremely knowledgable and skilled but is able to pitch things at the right level for the range of skill across the group. His good humour made the weekend great fun for all. Thanks",

He clearly tries to tailor his guidance to individual needs from the discussions at the beginning of the workshop. Alan offers a range of options for his workshops and it is clear that some participants had not known what they were looking for which makes it near impossible to satisfy those with wholly unrealistic expectations.  I will go again and hope to get more appropriate weather next time.",
