I received emails prior to the event with a list of equipment and directions to the course.  It was a small group, a relaxed atmosphere. Alan gave a small teaching session prior to starting the workshop. He explained anything you needed to learn and helped you understand depending on your knowledge/experience of photography.  There were four of us on the workshop. Alan gave us all one to one tuition. He displayed our images on a large screen and talked us through composition etc. He gave praise and constructive criticism, all on a one to one basis. I learned alot that day. I liked the way he offers tuition no matter what level you are.  He showed us some of his photography which was interesting. He really is a master in the field.  I highly recommend a photography course with him. I'd like to do more courses in the future.  Many thanks Alan for an enjoyable and most beautiful workshop in your stunning garden of mature plants and flowers. You really have a creative mind and I'm so glad you can teach your valuable photography skills to benefit others.",

He's a great teacher, who does not just simply shares his vast knowledge of photography, but also inspires you to want to learn all the (sometimes quite dry) technical details, so you can create amazing images that you can be proud of. I'm very happy for finding Alan right at the beginning of my photography journey and looking forward to attending more of his workshops in the future.",
