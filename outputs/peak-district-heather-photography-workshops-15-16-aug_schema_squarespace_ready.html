ModerateExperience Level: Beginner to AdvancedEquipment Needed: DSLR or Mirrorless Camera and TripodPhotography Workshop Event Details: HeathersDescription: Peak District heather WorkshopsSurprise View, perched atop Hathersage, is one of the best viewpoints in the Peak District. It's a perfect spot to admire the sunset and, on a clear night, is a designated 'Dark Skies' stargazing location. To access this special place, head uphill in a northerly direction from the car park and find the strangely shaped Mother Cap stone. Then, marvel at the vivid stars filling the Peak District's dark skies.The Roaches, with Hen Cloud and Ramshaw Rocks, form a gritstone escarpment that marks the Peak's south-western edge. Best viewed from the approach along the Leek road, they stand as a line of silent sentinels guarding the entrance to the Peak District, worn into fantastic shapes by the elements.",
