My reason for choosing Alan was that there is really very little on offer for Adult Education in Warwickshire. I'm not a car owner so I was extremely grateful that Alan was putting his courses on here in Kenilworth.  I really got everything I was looking for with Alan. He gives it his all and you certainly get value for money",
