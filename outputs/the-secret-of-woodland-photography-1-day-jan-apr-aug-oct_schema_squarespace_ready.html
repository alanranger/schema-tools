Led by Alan, the workshop adeptly combined theoretical insights with practical fieldwork, enhancing participants' technical skills and creative vision. The breathtaking Snowdonia vistas provided an ideal backdrop for mastering composition, lighting and exposure techniques, fostering a deeper appreciation for the art of landscape photography. The hands-on guidance and personalised feedback was commendable, enabling me to elevate my photography skills. Overall, the workshop's rich content, picturesque location and skilled mentor rendered it an indispensable opportunity for aspiring and seasoned photographers alike. I also enjoyed the relaxed social aspects of the workshop with first class accommodation provided.",
