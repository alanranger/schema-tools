The details about where/what we photographing were excellent and included weather forecast, tide times as well. We covered lots of locations over the 3 days. Got lots of really good tuition and loved the feedback sessions (on the days photos) in the evenings as it was dark early. A good group with same interest in learning more. One of my photos was also selected for this months banner on Alan's facebook group. Highly recommend to other photographers as it really gets you into the 'zone' to improve your skills.

We went to various locations so that everyone could get something including a lovely sun rise in Craster so time management was essential and Alan was flexible throughout the weekend adjusting the timetable so that we got the most out of the time we were in Northumbria. Restaurant on the Friday night was a good choice, nice food, also the fish and chip shop on the Friday excellent and good prices.  Not so good - hotel looked very nice from the pictures, but hygiene was a big issue for me, mouldy bath mat which got changed once I asked, and there was mould on the shower panel it is in need of refurbishment, bedroom furniture MFI quite flimsy.  I understand why Alan has selected it as it was conveniently located but they do need to address  these issues I am sure he will feed back to them as its in an ideal location.",

I always enjoy my time on workshops etc but this one was particular memorable  as Alan cleverly maximised the opportunities presented by the challenging weather conditions (wild and windy). I learned lots about making the most of the conditions and used quite advanced photography techniques - for example, long exposures, bracketing and taking more than one shot to subsequently 'mask' in photoshop. Great too to be out in the environment instead of huddled indoors!",

Was great to be able let Alan do the driving so we could relax between venues and concentrate on taking pictures. Felt Alan got the balance slightly wrong on first day between leaving us to our own devices without being invasive and perhaps offering more advice/help but given his 5 hour drive and the fact all three of us said we had at least 20 years of experience I wasn’t too bothered. Alan was very informative and helpful on 2nd and 3rd day with technical and artistic advice. Great locations and his knowledge of the area was very helpful in achieving some really good results which he was very helpful at dinner in giving advice on. Hands on advice of camera features and technical ideas really improved my results over the 3 days combined with being able to look through Alan’s camera at his framing and his final results at the various locations. Great choice of accommodation too with enjoyable meals to start and finish the days with chance to talk through the day and plan the next.   Will definitely be going on another workshop with Alan.",
