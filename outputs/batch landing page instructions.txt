ok thats a good start but

i want to be able to upload a csv file of urls the way we do with other tabs, so it will need the same design of debug log with copy button
it will need to be able to output all the json files formatted ready to paste to G:\Dropbox\alan ranger photography\Website Code\Schema Tools\outputs the same way we do for product schema
when it loads the csv urls it will need a table to show them and show columns for auto detected type and allow manual override via a drop down 
so it can process them using that schema template in a step 2 function

Can you think of any other enhancements?
