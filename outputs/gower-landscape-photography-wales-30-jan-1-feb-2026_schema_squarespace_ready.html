I have learnt a lot from his sessions and enjoyed them. His feedback is valuable. He's well organised and thorough. His work before the workshops makes for a really good experience.  He chooses nice places to stay and the social aspect is good too. I'd recommend the workshops although the Gower in June is going to be a challenge because of the time of year. Although it's nicer to stand outdoors in the summer, workshops in autumn and winter would be my preference. Anyway, if you're thinking of booking or buying a gift for someone.....do it!",
