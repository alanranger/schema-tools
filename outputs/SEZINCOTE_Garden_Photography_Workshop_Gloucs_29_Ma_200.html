Some decent locations and I felt Alan a struck a good balance between tuition and friendly travel companion ; undoubtedly a very competent tutor and I've picked up quite a bit personally. The midges and full-on sunlight were minor negatives, but that's the nature of these trips. Decent overnight accommodation and adequate meals etc. Very pleased with the experience and will look to participate again.",

      "reviewBody": "Over the course of a 1 Day Workshop in the Peaks, Alan imparted huge amounts of knowledge and energy, tailored specifically to the varied abilities of the attendees (I was probably the most \"amateur\" on the course).  I came away having learned a lot about the process of taking photographs, both in the technical sense but also in the sense of understanding the mental process to go through to see past the obvious and consider composition as well as deconstructing why it could go wrong to make it better.  A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me.",
