EasyExperience Level: Beginner to AdvancedEquipment Needed: DSLR or Mirrorless Camera and TripodWales Photography Workshop Event Details: Lake VyrnwyDescription: Pistyll Rhaeadr is an enchanting waterfall in the Berwyn Mountains, just inside Wales, west of Oswestry and Shrewsbury. At 240ft (73m) high, Britain's tallest single-drop waterfall (with a drop 20m higher than Niagara Falls) captivates all who visit her—known as one of the seven wonders of Wales with its three stages of drops. Generation after generation take in the spirit and presence of this remarkable place. Surrounding the falls is a viewing platform, bridge, and woodland alongside the Afon Rhaeadr.Pistyll Rhaeadr offers an excellent opportunity to practice long exposure photography of moving water with many viewpoints of the falls and also down at water level with its laminated slate beds and plenty of mini falls and closer-up compositions to make.Lake Vyrnwy is a reservoir in Powys, Wales, built in the 1880s for Liverpool Corporation Waterworks to supply Liverpool with fresh water. It flooded the head of the Vyrnwy valley and submerged the village of Llanwddyn. These two locations to give you a real taste of Wales photography",
