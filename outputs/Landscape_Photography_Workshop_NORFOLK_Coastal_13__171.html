We went to various locations so that everyone could get something including a lovely sun rise in Craster so time management was essential and Alan was flexible throughout the weekend adjusting the timetable so that we got the most out of the time we were in Northumbria. Restaurant on the Friday night was a good choice, nice food, also the fish and chip shop on the Friday excellent and good prices.  Not so good - hotel looked very nice from the pictures, but hygiene was a big issue for me, mouldy bath mat which got changed once I asked, and there was mould on the shower panel it is in need of refurbishment, bedroom furniture MFI quite flimsy.  I understand why Alan has selected it as it was conveniently located but they do need to address  these issues I am sure he will feed back to them as its in an ideal location.",

The weekend was planned really thoroughly to ensure we had a great selection of locations and spent a minimum amount of time in the car - although the agenda was flexible enough to move things around to suit conditions and the preferences of the group. Alan was always on hand to help with our pictures re settings, composition and equipment and would show is what he was doing as he was shooting as well. Accommodation and food stops all very good too. A thoroughly enjoyable weekend that has really helped with my photography",

It was extremely well organised, with a detailed itinerary which covered a huge range of locations to suit all tastes. His knowledge of the locations and where to get the best shots was excellent. The itinerary was adjusted according to the changes in weather and worked brilliantly. There was opportunity to try new techniques and creative styles with tuition or you can just do what you normally do in a beautiful place.  There were plenty of loo stops, a great B&B and some fantastic places to eat. I valued Alan's direct feedback and guidance, but he won't mince his words and will be honest and clear! Alan was always available for input but his style is not to be in your face, which our group appreciated. He is extremely knowledgable and skilled but is able to pitch things at the right level for the range of skill across the group. His good humour made the weekend great fun for all. Thanks",

I always enjoy my time on workshops etc but this one was particular memorable  as Alan cleverly maximised the opportunities presented by the challenging weather conditions (wild and windy). I learned lots about making the most of the conditions and used quite advanced photography techniques - for example, long exposures, bracketing and taking more than one shot to subsequently 'mask' in photoshop. Great too to be out in the environment instead of huddled indoors!",

Was great to be able let Alan do the driving so we could relax between venues and concentrate on taking pictures. Felt Alan got the balance slightly wrong on first day between leaving us to our own devices without being invasive and perhaps offering more advice/help but given his 5 hour drive and the fact all three of us said we had at least 20 years of experience I wasn’t too bothered. Alan was very informative and helpful on 2nd and 3rd day with technical and artistic advice. Great locations and his knowledge of the area was very helpful in achieving some really good results which he was very helpful at dinner in giving advice on. Hands on advice of camera features and technical ideas really improved my results over the 3 days combined with being able to look through Alan’s camera at his framing and his final results at the various locations. Great choice of accommodation too with enjoyable meals to start and finish the days with chance to talk through the day and plan the next.   Will definitely be going on another workshop with Alan.",

Good size group (5) so there were others to learn from but with plenty of dedicated time from Alan when requested. Will definitely go on another workshop and would highly recommend to other photographers",

I came away having learned a lot about the process of taking photographs, both in the technical sense but also in the sense of understanding the mental process to go through to see past the obvious and consider composition as well as deconstructing why it could go wrong to make it better.  A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me.",
