A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me.",

From the start, Alan's friendly and patient approach made learning easy and his genuine critique of our work was 'firm but fair' so we had useful feedback. For me, a key thing he said was 'photographers take photographs, not cameras'. There is little point in knowing all the settings on my camera if I do not see at what is around me and create photographs that share with others what I feel about what I see. I have returned to Alan for other courses and technical help and a one-to-one half-day workshop but particularly helpful is the monthly assignment and mentoring programme where he gives honest and constructive feedback.",
