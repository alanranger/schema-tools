          "reviewBody": "I recently attended the Landscape Photography Devon Workshop with Mr. Alan Ranger, and it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. The workshop was well-organized, with a detailed schedule and excellent information about each location — including the best times for sunrise, sunset, high tide, and low tide. Everything we needed to know was clearly explained and thoughtfully planned.  The choice of locations was perfect for training and practice. Each spot offered unique opportunities to experiment with composition, light, and timing. I must admit, I learned a lot of useful techniques, creative ideas, and ways to think differently about each shot — especially the importance of being patient and waiting for the right moment.  There were only three of us in total, which made the experience even more personal and interactive. I also learned a great deal from my fellow participants. The commuting distances between locations were short and comfortable, and Alan proved to be not only an excellent tutor but also an excellent driver!  Overall, this workshop was both educational and inspiring. I’m truly grateful for the experience and hope to join Alan again for more workshops in other locations.",
