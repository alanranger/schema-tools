As with the previous experiences Alans help, advice and humor made the afternoon very worthwhile and good value for money. Access to this private woodland as a small group was amazing, no kneeling in dog poop or hordes of Jo public to contend with!! Will be booking again next year.",

He works his way around the group making sure everyone get the advice and tips when needed whilst offering constructive ways of improving without being in your face. Came away with some of my best ever images of bluebells with a little help from the sun breaking though the trees. Would definitely recommend Alan Ranger Photography.",
