After a few hours of practising and asking Alan for advice how to improve shots, the results started to improve and by the end of the day I have some very pleasing pictures. Batsford Arboretum was a great location for this type of photography and there was more than enough subject matter to shoot; both macro and wide landscapes. Thanks Alan.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently attended one of Alan's workshops at Batsford Arboretum. The information that Alan provided in advance was very comprehensive, and included not just equipment required but also advice on clothing and food and drink. Not surprisingly, the theme of the workshop was 'Autumn leaves', and Alan started by stressing the importance of composition:no matter how expensive your kit or how technically skilled you are, these are of little value if what's in the frame is not interesting. After giving us some advice and a short demonstration he sent us off for half an hour to select our subject matter.  He then provided each of us with hands on guidance on how to take the best shots from both an artistic and technical point of view.  For example, he showed me some tricks available in my camera that I didn't know existed, and I'd never realized just how beautiful an oak leaf can be. In a few hours I learned a lot about photography in general and my camera's features in particular. For me, a very successful and inspiring day.",

      "reviewBody": "Very good session on autumn photography at Batsford arboretum (apparently TrustPilot don't allow links, so Google \"Alan Ranger Batsford\" :-) ). Particular good points: some good refreshers on very basic stuff (eg. custom white balance and using exposure bracketing), and some more advanced techniques on abstracts.  I've done a couple of photography workshops now, but this was the first with Alan Ranger. This one's easily the best value for money: much more one-on-one time with the instructor than most, and more effort to tailor to the students' particular needs/requirements.",

In this regard, it would be helpful to suggest a level of competence, advisable for the course.",

He is also honest in his comments and will not hesitate to point out things that are wrong - maybe things that other photographers havn't mentioned but at the end of the day we all learn from our mistakes perhaps more than our successes. I would certainly recommend Alan's workshops and will do more myself when I can.",

Had a great day and came away with many new skills and ideas, which I feel will give me something to think about, build on and improve my photography. Only 4 of us, so a nice small group with plenty of one to one tuition as needed.  A lot of emphasis was placed on observation and carefully choosing and thinking about what a shot should show and say, and trying to develop an eye for an interesting picture (Rather than just point and click); we experimented with taking shots for colour, landscape vistas, and close up macro photography of leaves, flowers, and fungi.    I also learnt a lot more about what my camera can do in terms of settings, exposures, focusing and light metering. I thought I knew my camera fairly well, but now can get so much more out of it.  In conclusion;  a fabulous day, with good company in a beautiful location, and I would have no hesitation in recommending.",

Different abilities within the workshop were catered for so well and the ratio of time to have a play and work things out for myself to teaching time was perfect. I was so chuffed with the photos that I left the workshop with, and felt so motivated and inspired. I would definitely recommend the 4 hour workshop to friends and family and hopefully will book onto another training session asap!!",
