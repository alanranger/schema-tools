EasyExperience Level: Beginner to AdvancedEquipment Needed: DSLR or Mirrorless Camera and TripodWales Photography Workshop Event Details: Lake VyrnwyDescription: Pistyll Rhaeadr is an enchanting waterfall in the Berwyn Mountains, just inside Wales, west of Oswestry and Shrewsbury. At 240ft (73m) high, Britain's tallest single-drop waterfall (with a drop 20m higher than Niagara Falls) captivates all who visit her—known as one of the seven wonders of Wales with its three stages of drops. Generation after generation take in the spirit and presence of this remarkable place. Surrounding the falls is a viewing platform, bridge, and woodland alongside the Afon Rhaeadr.Pistyll Rhaeadr offers an excellent opportunity to practice long exposure photography of moving water with many viewpoints of the falls and also down at water level with its laminated slate beds and plenty of mini falls and closer-up compositions to make.Lake Vyrnwy is a reservoir in Powys, Wales, built in the 1880s for Liverpool Corporation Waterworks to supply Liverpool with fresh water. It flooded the head of the Vyrnwy valley and submerged the village of Llanwddyn. These two locations to give you a real taste of Wales photography",

Alan drove us to some fantastic locations that I would never have found on my own. He showed us example photographs he had previously taken in the areas we visited to give us ideas for compositions. He was happy to help with any questions or advice you need, but you need to ask for help if you want it, otherwise he will leave you alone to do what you want; which suited me.  I have come back with more good photographs from one weekend trip than I would normally manage to get in a year.",

Alan provided fantastic advice and guidance throughout the workshop both technically and composition wise and provided a range of potential types of subjects.  Personally I learnt so much and actually saw some improvement in the quality of photos from day to day, due to the advice given on location and the helpful picture review sessions in the evenings.  Will definitely be booking a future workshop.",

Some decent locations and I felt Alan a struck a good balance between tuition and friendly travel companion ; undoubtedly a very competent tutor and I've picked up quite a bit personally.

Decent overnight accommodation and adequate meals etc. Very pleased with the experience and will look to participate again.",

I have enjoyed my photography for many years but knew that I need to understand the art rather than the technical side of image making. Alan was able to introduce the art side whilst relating to the technical so a win win situation for me. I am now looking forward to improving my compositional skills alongside Alan over the coming twelve months. A great weekend photo experience that i would recommend to others.",

Locations were chosen with our input to suite the changing weather conditions of early February. Alan is certainly knowledgeable and  passionate about photography and passes that on with humour and patience.",

I came away having learned a lot about the process of taking photographs, both in the technical sense but also in the sense of understanding the mental process to go through to see past the obvious and consider composition as well as deconstructing why it could go wrong to make it better.  A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me.",
