          "reviewBody": "Alan's workshop on the Kenilworth Castle Fireworks display was most enjoyable. Learnt quite a few new things to allow me to improve my own photography. Obviously a 1-1 session would give you more directed tutor time but fellow 'students' were all lovely and very happy to help each other. The session gave me confidence to go out next year and aim to get better and better shots, so thanks, Alan!",

As Alan discussed each topic I could readily link the content to specific photos I have been both happy and disappointed with in the past, without really knowing why. While the fundamentals of the camera are discussed, they are placed within the broader context of designing the shot you want.",

I also felt challenged and pushed beyond my previous comfort zone leading to a greater interest in getting better shots both technically and visually.    It was obvious that Alan had scouted the locations well and had taken the time to ensure that we got the best opportunity to make the most of the landscape of the lakes.",
