      "reviewBody": "Overall, a pretty good tour. Some decent locations and I felt Alan a struck a good balance between tuition and friendly travel companion ; undoubtedly a very competent tutor and I've picked up quite a bit personally. The midges and full-on sunlight were minor negatives, but that's the nature of these trips. Decent overnight accommodation and adequate meals etc. Very pleased with the experience and will look to participate again.",
