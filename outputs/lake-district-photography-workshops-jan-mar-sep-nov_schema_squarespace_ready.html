Alan drove us to areas of Lake District that I have never been. I have learnt simple basic stuff (setting up of tripods) to using of ND filters (borrowed from Alan) to Lightroom editing whenever opportunities arose. Alan is a good teacher with very clear mindset of how to take a good photograph.  He however, did leave us to try and compose our own photos ... I have enjoyed and learnt much from the feedback session. Thank you Alan.",

It was an extremely well-organised trip and I found the time spent in a 1-2-1 environment with Alan was invaluable. He gave me clear and specific tuition, with guidance and advice tailored just for me. He was always willing to answer my questions and explain his approach to shooting images. Having spent the day in the field in a small group, the image review and feedback sessions later on were really useful and informative. I would definitely recommend Alan to anyone who is keen to improve their photography skills.",

          "reviewBody": "I recently attended a photographic workshop hosted by Alan, and I can't express how invaluable the experience was. Initially, I felt overwhelmed with the intricate settings of my camera, but Alan demystified them in a way that was both comprehensible and reassuring. Beyond the technicalities, he instilled in me the ability to 'see' a photograph – to truly understand the essence of a scene and capture it effectively. He also provided hands-on guidance with my tripod, ensuring I maximized its potential for stable, crisp shots.  For anyone keen on elevating their photography skills, whether you're a beginner or someone looking to refine your craft, I would highly recommend Alan's courses. His expertise, coupled with his patient and insightful teaching style, truly sets him apart.  I hope this helps, and I'm glad I had such a positive experience! Remember to continue practicing and experimenting with your camera; the world of photography is vast and constantly evolving!",

Alan took us to brilliant locations and made sure everyone was comfortable with both the creative aspect of 'seeing the shot' and then attempting to execute it but fortunately stopped short of taking the shot for us to ensure we really learned from the experience. The evening feedback sessions reviewing our shots enabled us to modify technique on the subsequent days to improve the quality of our images.  He also helped me use Christmas presents like Expodisc to great effect and navigate the menus of my new Sony camera.  The domestic arrangements were also very good with friendly staff who were not fazed by a group of photopapers with muddy boots.",

He was happy to help with any questions or advice you need, but you need to ask for help if you want it, otherwise he will leave you alone to do what you want; which suited me.
