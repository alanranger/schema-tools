Alan is a good teacher with very clear mindset of how to take a good photograph.  He however, did leave us to try and compose our own photos ... I have enjoyed and learnt much from the feedback session. Thank you Alan.",

With his considerable knowledge and professional approach, I would strongly recommend one of these workshops, particularly if you want to take control of your camera rather than relying on the auto setting!",

It was an extremely well-organised trip and I found the time spent in a 1-2-1 environment with Alan was invaluable. He gave me clear and specific tuition, with guidance and advice tailored just for me. He was always willing to answer my questions and explain his approach to shooting images. Having spent the day in the field in a small group, the image review and feedback sessions later on were really useful and informative.

It's much appreciated.",

I found him very approachable and he offered up great ideas about composition and suggested using a polarising filter in situations I’d never thought of before. He was selfless in his support of all the participants and had a great sense of humour too. I thoroughly enjoyed the workshop, learned a few things (always good) and would recommend his workshops to photographers of all levels.",

It had a broad focus, so not just about the technical camera settings, but more about the planning and design of what you're trying to achieve.  Alan was clearly very passionate about photography, seeing it as an art form and expression of yourself.  Enjoyed the three hours and gave me exactly the introduction I was looking for.",
