I found the course useful and can't wait to book myself onto one of Alans workshops so I can put into practice what he has taught on this course. Many thanks... Highly recommended.",

The course was supported with a handbook which is very readable for a beginner's level of understanding.  The group was a small group which gave time for when you wanted to ask questions and for Alan to give time to individual students.  There was a lot of content which you could only fully take in by going home and reviewing / studying it.  Alan has a dry sense of humour which helped make the sessions enjoyable.",

He takes the time to make sure everyone understands and is happy to go over things again and again. The weekly assignments are fun and challenge you to think differently about your photography. Having the feedback for your images both educational and a boost in confidence. Can't put a price on what this course has taught me. Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level. But I learned more about the technical side of photography in the last 5 weeks than I did in all that previous time. A perfect spring board to take my photography that step further, and hopefully allow me to do what I love for a living. When time and money allow, I fully intend on going on future courses and workshops.",

I had attended a prior 1-day course with another company, and so my expectations were set around what I had experienced. However, after attending this course I was truly blown away.  Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.  There are flexible payment options available and I approached Alan initially to discuss my needs and he tailored a plan suitable for what I wanted to achieve.",

His own undoubted talents, wit and extensive knowledge was well conveyed, interacting fully with the participants thereby ensuring all his information and learning was passed on to all.  His method of teaching was certainly thoroughly enjoyable, inspirational and served to motivate one to pursue photography as a lifestyle choice, conveying all the benefits it could likely bring particularly in respect of opening up horizons that might otherwise go unnoticed.  I highly recommend this course to all who are contemplating a life through the lens.  You won't regret it.",

Oh and I've even been asked to sell some of my photos! Alan you've helped one of my dreams to come true - thank you!    Julie",

His knowledge and expertise is boundless and what is so refreshing is his willingness to share it!    That might sound odd, given you're paying for tuition, but you get so much more than simple facts, lessons and techniques.  Alan shares best practice, based on years of experience.  His passion and drive and love for his craft is evident.  A highly creative and artistic eye coupled with oodles of technical know-how, acres of experience and exceptionally high standards, and you've got yourself a tutor who raises the bar and challenges you to do the same.    I've completed almost 3 months's tuition to date and am already packing in much more next year!  You won't be disappointed - book today.",

Alan you deserve a big pat on the back for not only having the foresight to put a course like this together but providing students with the opportunity to go through a complete end to end process culminating in a public exhibition.    This is not about Alan standing up and teaching class room style week in week out. This is about him providing a structured project to See Design Shoot Enhance and Share your panel of images with his experience, guidance and support every step of the way.   Week 1 presented 9 nervous strangers all of whom thought they were completely out of their depth and wondering what the hell they were doing there.  16 weeks later we left as good friends having helped and supported each other throughout, confident in approaching the next stage of our photographic journey.    Many thanks Alan and thanks to fellow students for a brilliant few months.",
