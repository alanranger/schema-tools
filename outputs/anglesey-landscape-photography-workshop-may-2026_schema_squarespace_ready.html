He very clearly explains all the basic principles and shows you how to get the very best from your camera.  I have just enrolled on a workshop in the summer with Alan as I felt I learned so much from the first course. It's all put across in a fun and enjoyable way too. Despite having read articles on photography previously, these were no substitute for having Alan teach you in a class. He makes you think about the photographs you take and his superb landscape images inspire you to improve.I only wish I'd done the course earlier!",
