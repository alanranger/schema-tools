ModerateExperience Level: Beginner to AdvancedEquipment Needed: DSLR or Mirrorless Camera and TripodPhotography Workshop Event Details: HeathersDescription: Peak District heather WorkshopsSurprise View, perched atop Hathersage, is one of the best viewpoints in the Peak District. It's a perfect spot to admire the sunset and, on a clear night, is a designated 'Dark Skies' stargazing location. To access this special place, head uphill in a northerly direction from the car park and find the strangely shaped Mother Cap stone. Then, marvel at the vivid stars filling the Peak District's dark skies.The Roaches, with Hen Cloud and Ramshaw Rocks, form a gritstone escarpment that marks the Peak's south-western edge. Best viewed from the approach along the Leek road, they stand as a line of silent sentinels guarding the entrance to the Peak District, worn into fantastic shapes by the elements.",

He will devote all his expertise to enable you to improve your photography at any level, whether you are a beginner or think you know it all:))) and can't learn any more. If the conditions do not permit you to go on location, he will show you all sorts of helpful methodology in Lightroom, Photoshop etc.,  I would highly recommend Alan if you wish to improve your photography skills.",

      "reviewBody": "Over the course of a 1 Day Workshop in the Peaks, Alan imparted huge amounts of knowledge and energy, tailored specifically to the varied abilities of the attendees (I was probably the most \"amateur\" on the course).  I came away having learned a lot about the process of taking photographs, both in the technical sense but also in the sense of understanding the mental process to go through to see past the obvious and consider composition as well as deconstructing why it could go wrong to make it better.  A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me.",
