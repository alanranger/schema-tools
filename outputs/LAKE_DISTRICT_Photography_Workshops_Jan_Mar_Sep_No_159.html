      "reviewBody": "I had a very enjoyable three day photography trip with Alan Ranger in the Lake District staying near Keswick.  Alan drove us to some fantastic locations that I would never have found on my own. He showed us example photographs he had previously taken in the areas we visited to give us ideas for compositions. He was happy to help with any questions or advice you need, but you need to ask for help if you want it, otherwise he will leave you alone to do what you want; which suited me.  I have come back with more good photographs from one weekend trip than I would normally manage to get in a year.",

      "reviewBody": "Had a very enjoyable long weekend in the Lake District with Alan Ranger Photography. Great Worksop itinerary provided beforehand with helpful photos and locations. Alan provided fantastic advice and guidance throughout the workshop both technically and composition wise and provided a range of potential types of subjects.  Personally I learnt so much and actually saw some improvement in the quality of photos from day to day, due to the advice given on location and the helpful picture review sessions in the evenings.  Will definitely be booking a future workshop.",

Despite the weather keeping us indoors for a while we used the down time for tuition on post production editing which was transformational in terms of the end results.  All in all I gained a huge amount of knowledge and confidence.  Alan I look forward to joining another weekend in due course.",

He will devote all his expertise to enable you to improve your photography at any level, whether you are a beginner or think you know it all:))) and can't learn any more. If the conditions do not permit you to go on location, he will show you all sorts of helpful methodology in Lightroom, Photoshop etc.,  I would highly recommend Alan if you wish to improve your photography skills.",

As soon as I got home I booked another weekend trip for next year.",

      "reviewBody": "The two day workshop held in the Lakes ticked all the boxes for photo techniques and more importantly for me offered an introduction to composition. I have enjoyed my photography for many years but knew that I need to understand the art rather than the technical side of image making. Alan was able to introduce the art side whilst relating to the technical so a win win situation for me. I am now looking forward to improving my compositional skills alongside Alan over the coming twelve months. A great weekend photo experience that i would recommend to others.",

Alan's tutoring touch was light but accurately placed so that so that we (a group of 3 plus Alan) had ample time to  understand and put into practice his advice without feeling pressured. Locations were chosen with our input to suite the changing weather conditions of early February. Alan is certainly knowledgeable and  passionate about photography and passes that on with humour and patience.",

      "reviewBody": "Over the course of a 1 Day Workshop in the Peaks, Alan imparted huge amounts of knowledge and energy, tailored specifically to the varied abilities of the attendees (I was probably the most \"amateur\" on the course).  I came away having learned a lot about the process of taking photographs, both in the technical sense but also in the sense of understanding the mental process to go through to see past the obvious and consider composition as well as deconstructing why it could go wrong to make it better.  A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me.",

I have signed up for many more of Alan's courses/workshop as I love his teaching style.   Thank you Alan for all your support so far in my photography journey :)",
