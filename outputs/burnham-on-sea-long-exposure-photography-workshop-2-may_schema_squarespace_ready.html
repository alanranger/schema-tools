Alan really made the most of the wild and windy conditions and chose great locations to provide opportunities to learn more about fairly advanced techniques such as long exposures, bracketing and taking more than one shot to subsequently 'mask' in photoshop. A fantastic learning experience and great fun! Thanks Alan.",
