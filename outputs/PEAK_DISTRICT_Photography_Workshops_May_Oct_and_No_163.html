The gorge is wooded with a stream, the Burbage Brook, at the bottom. Padley provides numerous opportunities to refine your composition in many aspects. You can opt for close-up sketches of woodland growth, rocks and water or tackle a wider vista showing the river and work on long exposures, water abstracts and much more.Bolehill Quarry - Created hundreds of millions of years ago by the power of natural forces, the last few centuries have seen the rugged landscape surrounding Padley Gorge sculpted by man who long ago quarried these gritstone Edges for stone and tunnelled deep beneath the moors to drive a railway line through the hills. Now an area of outstanding natural beauty, this walk takes in the breathtaking heights of Millstone Edge and majestic silver birch woodlands. It's a great location for any level of photographer to hone their skills and techniques.",

He will devote all his expertise to enable you to improve your photography at any level, whether you are a beginner or think you know it all:))) and can't learn any more. If the conditions do not permit you to go on location, he will show you all sorts of helpful methodology in Lightroom, Photoshop etc.,  I would highly recommend Alan if you wish to improve your photography skills.",

      "reviewBody": "Over the course of a 1 Day Workshop in the Peaks, Alan imparted huge amounts of knowledge and energy, tailored specifically to the varied abilities of the attendees (I was probably the most \"amateur\" on the course).  I came away having learned a lot about the process of taking photographs, both in the technical sense but also in the sense of understanding the mental process to go through to see past the obvious and consider composition as well as deconstructing why it could go wrong to make it better.  A superb coach and a superb course.  A very strong recommendation for me.",
