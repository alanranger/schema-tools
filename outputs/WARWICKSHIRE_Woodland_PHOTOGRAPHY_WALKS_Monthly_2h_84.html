EasyExperience Level: Novice to BeginnerEquipment Needed: Phone or Digital CameraPhotography Workshop Event Details: Woodland WalksDescription: Simplifying Woodland Photography: Unlocking the Secrets to Capturing the Beauty of Nature on a photography walkMy aim is not to instruct you what to shoot, instead, I want to help you develop your own sense of visual awareness, photographic eye and your personal interpretation. I will be happy to help you with the “how to shoot” whatever it is you feel drawn to and wish to express through your creative vision using the camera to construct your intention. The photography walks around these selected woodlands are aimed to promote our senses and connection to trees/woodland/nature - as we walk, observe and take in our environment we may decide to make a photograph, or not.",
