Alan has not only excellent presentation skills, but he had prepared the event with some thought, for instance arranging the seating to allow people with similar hardware to sit near to each other.  He changed my views on how I should be taking my hobby forward.",

          "reviewBody": "I've wanted a 'proper' camera (ie. A DSLR) for a long time and I got one for Christmas. I love it, but have no idea how to use all the settings to get the best out of it, so after seeing the 'photography made easy' course online, I decided to book onto it.     I found out after booking that the course was a 'lecture' format so I was a bit skeptical, thinking that I probably wouldn't learn a whole lot. I was completely wrong! Although it's not practical, it is really interactive and Alan encourages lots of participation, questions, thoughts etc. The course covers the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO etc. necessary for you to go home and experiment, knowing what all the settings on the camera dial are. Alan was very patient and didn't mind explaining numerous times what certain things are when the class for confused!    I enjoyed the course very much and I have now signed up to the extended course, because I believe I will greatly benefit from doing practical work with Alan. Thank you very much!",

Alan responded quickly and was very professional and we went along for a 2 hour session.  In the session he was informative and knowledgeable and we learnt a lot. He explained what he could offer as well as advising on things we were not sure on and from this we decided to book his premium mentoring and also 12 121 sessions to take throughout the year. Highly recommend if you are seeking someone to give you guidance on knowledge on photography!",
