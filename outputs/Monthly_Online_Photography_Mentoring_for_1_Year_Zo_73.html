It helped no end, he has the knack of pinpointing exactly where I was going wrong and his criticism is constructive and easy to hear. The only reason I've stopped is because I improved and ended up with too much work. His mentoring is something I would recommend and that I'd go back to if I felt I needed more help in the future",
