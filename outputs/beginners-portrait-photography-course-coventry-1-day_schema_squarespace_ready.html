Initially, I felt overwhelmed with the intricate settings of my camera, but Alan demystified them in a way that was both comprehensible and reassuring. Beyond the technicalities, he instilled in me the ability to 'see' a photograph – to truly understand the essence of a scene and capture it effectively. He also provided hands-on guidance with my tripod, ensuring I maximized its potential for stable, crisp shots.  For anyone keen on elevating their photography skills, whether you're a beginner or someone looking to refine your craft, I would highly recommend Alan's courses. His expertise, coupled with his patient and insightful teaching style, truly sets him apart.  I hope this helps, and I'm glad I had such a positive experience! Remember to continue practicing and experimenting with your camera; the world of photography is vast and constantly evolving!",

I came away feeling inspired, having grown my confidence in my camera considerably and excited to continue practising, improving and hopefully attending some of Alan's other courses in the future.",

The course was supported with a handbook which is very readable for a beginner's level of understanding. The group was a small group which gave time for when you wanted to ask questions and for Alan to give time to individual students. There was a lot of content which you could only fully take in by going home and reviewing / studying it. Alan has a dry sense of humour which helped make the sessions enjoyable!",
