While the sunny weather wasn’t ideal for long exposure shots, the session was still fantastic. Over the course of two hours, our small group (typically allows 6 people per event) received insightful guidance from Alan, who proved to be an excellent tutor. His deep knowledge and approachable teaching style made the lesson valuable for both beginners and advanced photographers alike. He helped us set up our cameras and provided clear explanations of the fundamental principles, ensuring everyone got the most out of the experience.",

Already signed up the monthly mentoring, which I’m hoping with continue to improve my knowledge and skills. Look forward to the workshops in the future. Thanks Alan.",

Mostly a brief overview of the non-automatic modes and then you're sent out to take pictures. What this means is you don't really learn anything. I was therefore a bit cautious about booking this one in case it was similar. It couldn't have been more different.  I recently completed the 'Get Off Auto' course as a taster session and found this to be excellent. Alan covers everything you need to known in a 2.5 hour session and rather than sending you out blindly to take photo's - these are given as exercises to complete in your own time - meaning you have more time to explore each topic and ask the questions that you really want to ask.   The first week introduction is a good starter and is the natural lead in to the 4 week beginners course.",

I wanted a lesson on the other settings the camera offers in order to progress and completely forget Auto all together! Alan was very precise, fun and made sure we understood one component before moving on to another! I have used my camera off Auto many many times and have at times felt like I’ll never master this!! However, this workshop helped me understand what I am doing wrong... seriously thinking of following it up with another of Alan’s workshops 😊",

Admittedly, there was some content that i was aware of already, but Alan shared this during the four weeks in a way that explained the reasoning behind his methods. I found the course useful and can't wait to book myself onto one of Alans workshops so I can put into practice what he has taught on this course. Many thanks... Highly recommended.",

The course was supported with a handbook which is very readable for a beginner's level of understanding.  The group was a small group which gave time for when you wanted to ask questions and for Alan to give time to individual students.  There was a lot of content which you could only fully take in by going home and reviewing / studying it.  Alan has a dry sense of humour which helped make the sessions enjoyable.",
