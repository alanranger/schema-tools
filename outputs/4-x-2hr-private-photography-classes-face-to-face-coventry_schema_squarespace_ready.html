He gave loads of tips on composition and helped me set my camera up just how I want it. His critique of my photos felt a bit brutal at times, but was all true and he has given me a lot of pointers on how to improve.",

He is a great teacher and I would fully recommend a 1-2-1 session with him which is tailored to each individual. Worth every penny!",

His engaging delivery, course materials and open, honest and supportive approach encouraged me to enroll on further workshops and 1-2-1 feedback.   As a service provider the company provides relevant, up to date and comprehensive information relating not just to technical elements of photography but also tips on defeloping personal style and creative intention. The range of classes and workshops is diverse and suits a range of experience. Seasonal and locational workshops are also added often to suit varying interests. These are publicised via website, facebook and email.  I feel that with Alans expert support I am now making the transition from enthusiastic snapper to informed and inspired photographer!   Thank you",
