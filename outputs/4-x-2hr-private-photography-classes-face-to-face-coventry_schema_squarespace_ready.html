As a service provider the company provides relevant, up to date and comprehensive information relating not just to technical elements of photography but also tips on defeloping personal style and creative intention. The range of classes and workshops is diverse and suits a range of experience. Seasonal and locational workshops are also added often to suit varying interests. These are publicised via website, facebook and email.  I feel that with Alans expert support I am now making the transition from enthusiastic snapper to informed and inspired photographer!
