Alan took us to brilliant locations and made sure everyone was comfortable with both the creative aspect of 'seeing the shot' and then attempting to execute it but fortunately stopped short of taking the shot for us to ensure we really learned from the experience. The evening feedback sessions reviewing our shots enabled us to modify technique on the subsequent days to improve the quality of our images.  He also helped me use Christmas presents like Expodisc to great effect and navigate the menus of my new Sony camera.  The domestic arrangements were also very good with friendly staff who were not fazed by a group of photopapers with muddy boots.",

Alan drove us to some fantastic locations that I would never have found on my own. He showed us example photographs he had previously taken in the areas we visited to give us ideas for compositions. He was happy to help with any questions or advice you need, but you need to ask for help if you want it, otherwise he will leave you alone to do what you want; which suited me.  I have come back with more good photographs from one weekend trip than I would normally manage to get in a year.",

Alan provided fantastic advice and guidance throughout the workshop both technically and composition wise and provided a range of potential types of subjects.  Personally I learnt so much and actually saw some improvement in the quality of photos from day to day, due to the advice given on location and the helpful picture review sessions in the evenings.  Will definitely be booking a future workshop.",

After a few hours of practising and asking Alan for advice how to improve shots, the results started to improve and by the end of the day I have some very pleasing pictures. Batsford Arboretum was a great location for this type of photography and there was more than enough subject matter to shoot; both macro and wide landscapes. Thanks Alan.",
