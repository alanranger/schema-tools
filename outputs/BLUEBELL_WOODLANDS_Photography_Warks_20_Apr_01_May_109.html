I never expected to come out of one workshop and be a professional. Alan was patient, knowledgeable and on hand. I now understand my camera a little more. I had a lovely morning with a great group of people, walking in mud and learning how to take a picture. Thank you Alan for a great experience! I will be looking to book in the future!",

I hardly knew how to turn on the camera.. What a fantastic morning.. Breathtaking location, great company and group dynamic with the 4 others due to Alan's relaxed style, he was completely unperturbed by my beginners stupidity and had great time and patience with us all. Met some lovely people and even managed a decent shot... Now for the sunflowers in the summer!! Thanks Alan ..",
