I never expected to come out of one workshop and be a professional. Alan was patient, knowledgeable and on hand. I now understand my camera a little more. I had a lovely morning with a great group of people, walking in mud and learning how to take a picture. Thank you Alan for a great experience! I will be looking to book in the future!",

The location for the Bluebell workshop was simply amazing, almost overwhelming, making it great fun with like-minded photo-folk.     Alan's encouraging and inspirational style was very welcome, and he was very open in demonstrating his techniques for composition, things to look for and things to make a better image.     A great morning!",

I hardly knew how to turn on the camera.. What a fantastic morning.. Breathtaking location, great company and group dynamic with the 4 others due to Alan's relaxed style, he was completely unperturbed by my beginners stupidity and had great time and patience with us all. Met some lovely people and even managed a decent shot... Now for the sunflowers in the summer!! Thanks Alan ..",

Starting early, he gave each of us time and help to get our cameras set up and ready to shoot. Once the fireworks started he checked with each of us that everything was going according to plan, giving guidance as needed.  I got some great photos - really pleased I went!",

      "reviewBody": "Alan's workshop on the Kenilworth Castle Fireworks display was most enjoyable. Learnt quite a few new things to allow me to improve my own photography. Obviously a 1-1 session would give you more directed tutor time but fellow 'students' were all lovely and very happy to help each other. The session gave me confidence to go out next year and aim to get better and better shots, so thanks, Alan!",
