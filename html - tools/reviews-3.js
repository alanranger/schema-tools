I had attended a prior 1-day course with another company, and so my expectations were set around what I had experienced. However, after attending this course I was truly blown away.  Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.  There are flexible payment options available and I approached Alan initially to discuss my needs and he tailored a plan suitable for what I wanted to achieve."}, {"author": "Ian Blake", "source": "Trustpilot", "event": "Great weekend in Northumberland", "rating": 5, "date": "01/12/2016 22:14", "review": "Friday through Sunday, some great locations and a different eye on them too, rather than just the usual 'tourist' shots Good cottage to stay in.

I also learnt a lot more about what my camera can do in terms of settings, exposures, focusing and light metering. I thought I knew my camera fairly well, but now can get so much more out of it.
