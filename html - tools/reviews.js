His enthusiasm to capture images and learn photography in the most challenging conditions was infectious. If we were unable to venture outside, we spent our time learning some extremely useful methods in Lightroom & Photoshop together with a variety of other software packages. I would highly recommend Alan if you are wanting to not only have a great experience in stunning scenery on his workshops, but also in the classroom to improve your photography beyond expectation. You won't be disappointed. Thank you Alan",

His expertise and constructive critique during the first session enabled him to tailor a session suitable for me for No 2. We discussed black and white photography and concentrated on editing some of my previous shots using software add-ons to the Lightroom program, which I already use. While I am by no means anywhere near expert quality, Alans teaching style has given me the confidence to take my photography to the next level. Alan offers as many 1-2-1 sessions as you feel you will need, but for me, I have chosen to use my other 2 sessions in a workshop situation, allowing me to get out and about with other photographers in the field and learn more techniques with guidance from Alan. One real positive that has come from this was an immediate solution to a problem I had been suffering with my photo editing. This was due to Lightroom being updated recently and my Mac not being able to cope. Since upgrading my RAM, following Alans recommendation, the performance and speed of my software has been much improved, allowing my to spend more time doing decent edits instead of waiting like I was before. Many thanks for all your help so far, and looking forward to the next one.",

The evening feedback sessions reviewing our shots enabled us to modify technique on the subsequent days to improve the quality of our images. He also helped me use Christmas presents like Expodisc to great effect and navigate the menus of my new Sony camera.

He was happy to help with any questions or advice you need, but you need to ask for help if you want it, otherwise he will leave you alone to do what you want; which suited me.

I accept that the event is not costly and isn\u2019t tuition-based but I\u2019m not sure we gained a lot from what we could have done ourselves. However, this may have been partly our fault as we were a small group and may not have engaged with the photography as much as we could have done. We lost Alan in the latter part of the walk as people splintered off to take the photographs they wanted - many of those who sign up to his outdoor events I feel are seasoned photographers. It was stated we could ask for help but I would suggest that a way to make an improvement for less experienced photographers would be for him to make a few proactive suggestions as to suitable apertures etc at the start of the walk which would make people feel they had gained something above what they could do on their own. It would also encourage them to go again. We do hope to come on another walk at some time in the future though and I would look forward to my results being rather better!",

I was therefore a bit cautious about booking this one in case it was similar. It couldn't have been more different. I recently completed the 'Get Off Auto' course as a taster session and found this to be excellent. Alan covers everything you need to known in a 2.5 hour session and rather than sending you out blindly to take photo's - these are given as exercises to complete in your own time - meaning you have more time to explore each topic and ask the questions that you really want to ask. The first week introduction is a good starter and is the natural lead in to the 4 week beginners course.",

Not surprisingly, the theme of the workshop was 'Autumn leaves', and Alan started by stressing the importance of composition:no matter how expensive your kit or how technically skilled you are, these are of little value if what's in the frame is not interesting. After giving us some advice and a short demonstration he sent us off for half an hour to select our subject matter. He then provided each of us with hands on guidance on how to take the best shots from both an artistic and technical point of view. For example, he showed me some tricks available in my camera that I didn't know existed, and I'd never realized just how beautiful an oak leaf can be. In a few hours I learned a lot about photography in general and my camera's features in particular. For me, a very successful and inspiring day.",

It then took many attempts to find a date that worked for myself and for Alan. The details for joining the workshop came a couple of days before the event. It did recommend a filter that I didn't have but it was too late to buy it from Amazon. No real problem through as we did really need it. The first 15 minutes of the workshop were tuition and I picked up a few very useful tips from the workshop which I will use in future. The rest of the workshop is you photograph the subject and move around the site at your own pace but not too far from the group so Alan can move around each individual and answer questions, review photos and give advice. You are expected to ask questions and learn more that way. I personally find that I don't think of questions until much later when the learning experience has really soaked in. So it would have been good to stop and specifically talk about a topic. I plan to visit the location again on a different day and try again now I have seen my photos. I will definitely consider booking again in the future depending on the subjects.",

I never expected to come out of one workshop and be a professional. Alan was patient, knowledgeable and on hand. I now understand my camera a little more.

The session itself was of little benefit to me, as he was more interested in three other members of the group who obviously were impressed with his constant name dropping of where his photographs had appeared. He told us at the beginning of the day long session it was up to us to go and take photographs and then he would circulate and look at our results. He then proceeded to wander off with his own camera and click away to his own benefit. Yes he did come over to me once all day and went through my photos. I found his comments unhelpful, but I guess by this time I had realised that this course and tutor was not for me. The day could not end soon enough for me.

What we will see, what we could be looking for to frame a shot, alternative viewpoints, what obvious mistakes to avoid. How to set up the camera, which lens, mode, exposure depth of field etc and whether there were any questions on reaching our destination. Instead on arrival Alan marched us straight to where he thought the best image was with no discussion, set up his camera and really had little by way of Q & A on site leaving everyone to pretty much get on with it. He reviewed the images captured over the evening meal and made comments by which time it was of course too late to consider changing composition or camera settings. This is learning by ones mistakes after the photographic opportunity has passed and not taking advantage of a professionals knowledge to consider how to improve whilst the opportunity is in front of you. I did ask the others on our trip how they thought the trip was going and I agreed with much of their comments which I have repeated here. I have resisted reviewing Alans trip since October 2017 as I think he believes he is doing a good job and will not be receptive to negative comments.",

Was great to be able let Alan do the driving so we could relax between venues and concentrate on taking pictures. Felt Alan got the balance slightly wrong on first day between leaving us to our own devices without being invasive and perhaps offering more advice/help but given his 5 hour drive and the fact all three of us said we had at least 20 years of experience I wasn\u2019t too bothered. Alan was very informative and helpful on 2nd and 3rd day with technical and artistic advice. Great locations and his knowledge of the area was very helpful in achieving some really good results which he was very helpful at dinner in giving advice on. Hands on advice of camera features and technical ideas really improved my results over the 3 days combined with being able to look through Alan\u2019s camera at his framing and his final results at the various locations. Great choice of accommodation too with enjoyable meals to start and finish the days with chance to talk through the day and plan the next. Will definitely be going on another workshop with Alan.",

Having the feedback for your images both educational and a boost in confidence. Can't put a price on what this course has taught me. Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level. But I learned more about the technical side of photography in the last 5 weeks than I did in all that previous time. A perfect spring board to take my photography that step further, and hopefully allow me to do what I love for a living.

I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate. If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.

A lot of emphasis was placed on observation and carefully choosing and thinking about what a shot should show and say, and trying to develop an eye for an interesting picture (Rather than just point and click); we experimented with taking shots for colour, landscape vistas, and close up macro photography of leaves, flowers, and fungi. I also learnt a lot more about what my camera can do in terms of settings, exposures, focusing and light metering. I thought I knew my camera fairly well, but now can get so much more out of it.

I found out after booking that the course was a 'lecture' format so I was a bit skeptical, thinking that I probably wouldn't learn a whole lot. I was completely wrong! Although it's not practical, it is really interactive and Alan encourages lots of participation, questions, thoughts etc. The course covers the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO etc. necessary for you to go home and experiment, knowing what all the settings on the camera dial are. Alan was very patient and didn't mind explaining numerous times what certain things are when the class for confused! I enjoyed the course very much and I have now signed up to the extended course, because I believe I will greatly benefit from doing practical work with Alan. Thank you very much!",

So, with not much preparation other than the informative email from Alan, off I drove to the Kenilworth session, not knowing quite what to expect. The venue was good, parking well lit and room was more than adequate. You would think that 3 hours of listening and trying to understand the very basics of photography would drag, but actually the time went fast. Alan was knowledgeable, keen to impart that knowledge, and all 11 of us in the room made some small or large contribution to the evening. I have come away knowing a lot more than I knew when I started, and am looking forward to recharging those camera batteries to take photographs (not snaps!) that have been created, not snapped with hopefulness! As a stand alone evening this was a great start. There is the opportunity to continue on the 5 week course at a discounted rate if booked on the evening, however my personal feeling was that I would prefer to start practicing with my Bridge camera before committing a further \u00a3175 (\u00a3200 if booked after the easy photography evening).

He has so much patience and his passion for photography enables him to teach it in a clear and precise manner. I have signed up for many more of Alan's courses/workshop as I love his teaching style. Thank you Alan for all your support so far in my photography journey :)",

Starting early, he gave each of us time and help to get our cameras set up and ready to shoot. Once the fireworks started he checked with each of us that everything was going according to plan, giving guidance as needed. I got some great photos - really pleased I went!",

Pinpoints of light in a sea of black, not what I was after at all. Then I took some classes. My camera no longer sits unloved and unused. Settings are unlocked, a whole new world of photography opened up. Definitely courses well worth doing",

Obviously a 1-1 session would give you more directed tutor time but fellow 'students' were all lovely and very happy to help each other. The session gave me confidence to go out next year and aim to get better and better shots, so thanks, Alan!",

I wanted a bespoke session just for one item but didnt have a clue about cameras and how to shoot. I had a quick technical tutorial with a review of which camera was good, within price range and expertise, and then some example shooting. Four hours flew by and would like to do more. Alan was excellent, his pictures are testament to his work and knowledge. Would highly recommend.",

    "text": "I had a little knowledge of photography but wanted a course that would help me understand from the basic essentials onwards so that I could get more from my camera. From the start, Alan's friendly and patient approach made learning easy and his genuine critique of our work was 'firm but fair' so we had useful feedback. For me, a key thing he said was 'photographers take photographs, not cameras'. There is little point in knowing all the settings on my camera if I do not see at what is around me and create photographs that share with others what I feel about what I see. I have returned to Alan for other courses and technical help and a one-to-one half-day workshop but particularly helpful is the monthly assignment and mentoring programme where he gives honest and constructive feedback.",

Alan you deserve a big pat on the back for not only having the foresight to put a course like this together but providing students with the opportunity to go through a complete end to end process culminating in a public exhibition. This is not about Alan standing up and teaching class room style week in week out. This is about him providing a structured project to See Design Shoot Enhance and Share your panel of images with his experience, guidance and support every step of the way. (Perhaps \u201cSell\u201d should also be added to that list!) Week 1 presented 9 nervous strangers all of whom thought they were completely out of their depth and wondering what the hell they were doing there. 16 weeks later we left as good friends having helped and supported each other throughout, confident in approaching the next stage of our photographic journey. Many thanks Alan and thanks to fellow students for a brilliant few months.",

His engaging delivery, course materials and open, honest and supportive approach encouraged me to enroll on further workshops and 1-2-1 feedback. As a service provider the company provides relevant, up to date and comprehensive information relating not just to technical elements of photography but also tips on defeloping personal style and creative intention. The range of classes and workshops is diverse and suits a range of experience. Seasonal and locational workshops are also added often to suit varying interests. These are publicised via website, facebook and email. I feel that with Alans expert support I am now making the transition from enthusiastic snapper to informed and inspired photographer! Thank you",
