Ms Allen,My son went on the course at Brandon Marshes and produced some really fantastic photos.  He had taken photography at GCSE and was doing the Arts Award.  He thought he had learnt more with Alan than the whole of his GCSE course.  Alan provided helpful information about buying further equipment.  My son has improved his skill considerably and his love of photography has grown.  Thank you Alan.,5,Abstract and Macro Workshop,04/08/2018 18:33,Trustpilot
Swoopee13,"This was a very interesting and useful workshop. However be aware that it focuses on nature, not the bird life at Brandon Marsh. This disappointed me a little as I enjoy taking pictures of birds and was hoping for some advice, but understand that it isn’t suitable for everyone.",4,Abstract and Macro Workshop,19/08/2019 23:01,Trustpilot
Janet Boulter,"Macro masterclass - informative and good technical content followed by practical application session. All delivered with clarity and humour as always. Alan's classes are never rigid and flex and flow with the clients needs, which always expands the scope of the event. Came away with new ideas for macro photography. Would recommend.",4,Abstract and Macro Workshop,13/02/2018 12:27,Trustpilot
Dave Smith,Alan Ranger provided a very comprehensive and concise theory and practical training package for our group. I was able to take what I learned away from the course and make immediate improvements to my own macro photography.,5,Abstract and Macro Workshop,19/08/2019 21:20,Trustpilot
Doug Goddard,An enjoyable day with some good technical advice. I would have liked more time on the practical in the field and this would have allowed more one-to-one guidance.,4,Abstract and Macro Workshop,06/08/2019 20:08,Trustpilot
