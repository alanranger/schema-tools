I always enjoy my time on workshops etc but this one was particular memorable  as Alan cleverly maximised the opportunities presented by the challenging weather conditions (wild and windy). I learned lots about making the most of the conditions and used quite advanced photography techniques - for example, long exposures, bracketing and taking more than one shot to subsequently 'mask' in photoshop. Great too to be out in the environment instead of huddled indoors!"}, {"author": "nathan", "source": "Trustpilot", "event": "4-Week Beginners Photography course", "rating": 5, "date": "09/10/2018 18:12", "review": "I have been on a workshop with Alan and taken the beginers coarse ,classroom based.

I was not upset about the cancellation as the reason was due to a change in conditions and the I was pleased it didn't go ahead when there would be nothing to photograph.  It then took many attempts to find a date that worked for myself and for Alan.    The details for joining the workshop came a couple of days before the event.  It did recommend a filter that I didn't have but it was too late to buy it from Amazon.  No real problem through as we did really need it.  The first 15 minutes of the workshop were tuition and I picked up a few very useful tips from the workshop which I will use in future.  The rest of the workshop is you photograph the subject and move around the site at your own pace but not too far from the group so Alan can move around each individual and answer questions, review photos and give advice.  You are expected to ask questions and learn more that way.  I personally find that I don't think of questions until much later when the learning experience has really soaked in.  So it would have been good to stop and specifically talk about a topic.    I plan to visit the location again on a different day and try again now I have seen my photos.  I will definitely consider booking again in the future depending on the subjects."}, {"author": "Helen Curtis", "source": "Trustpilot", "event": "Get off Auto Class", "rating": 4, "date": "05/09/2018 07:19", "review": "Great intro!

How to set up the camera, which lens, mode, exposure depth of field etc and whether there were any questions on reaching our destination. Instead on arrival Alan marched us straight to where he thought the best image was with no discussion, set up his camera and really had little by way of Q & A on site leaving everyone to pretty much get on with it. He reviewed the images captured over the evening meal and made comments by which time it was of course too late to consider changing composition or camera settings. This is learning by ones mistakes after the photographic opportunity has passed and not taking advantage of a professionals knowledge to consider how to improve whilst the opportunity is in front of you. I did ask the others on our trip how they thought the trip was going and I agreed with much of their comments which I have repeated here.

The first 15 minutes of the workshop were tuition and I picked up a few very useful tips from the workshop which I will use in future.  The rest of the workshop is you photograph the subject and move around the site at your own pace but not too far from the group so Alan can move around each individual and answer questions, review photos and give advice.  You are expected to ask questions and learn more that way.  I personally find that I don't think of questions until much later when the learning experience has really soaked in.

Their was little or no preparation on the scene we were about to visit. What we will see, what we could be looking for to frame a shot, alternative viewpoints, what obvious mistakes to avoid. How to set up the camera, which lens, mode, exposure depth of field etc and whether there were any questions on reaching our destination. Instead on arrival Alan marched us straight to where he thought the best image was with no discussion, set up his camera and really had little by way of Q & A on site leaving everyone to pretty much get on with it. He reviewed the images captured over the evening meal and made comments by which time it was of course too late to consider changing composition or camera settings. This is learning by ones mistakes after the photographic opportunity has passed and not taking advantage of a professionals knowledge to consider how to improve whilst the opportunity is in front of you. I did ask the others on our trip how they thought the trip was going and I agreed with much of their comments which I have repeated here. I have resisted reviewing Alans trip since October 2017 as I think he believes he is doing a good job and will not be receptive to negative comments."}, {"author": "Elaine", "source": "Trustpilot", "event": "Alan Ranger Photography", "rating": 4, "date": "03/04/2018 13:36", "review": "I really enjoyed the day out with Alan at Batsford Arboretum.

There wasnt a question that he could not answer and explained things in a way that made perfect sense.

I had fabulous 3 days of 1 to 1 with Alan and learned a lot from him. I would definitely in the future love to learn more from him.

The course content is really down-to-earth with a definite focus on the end result of improving your photography, rather than getting bogged down in the technical minutiae of every little thing.  It will take a long time to absorb and practice the skills learnt in this course, but it has definitely served as a great foundation to take me beyond simple auto snapping.

The 5 week beginners course was perfect for me. Alan is a brilliant teacher who explains things clearly and in an easy-to-understand way. He takes the time to make sure everyone understands and is happy to go over things again and again. The weekly assignments are fun and challenge you to think differently about your photography. Having the feedback for your images both educational and a boost in confidence. Can't put a price on what this course has taught me. Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level. But I learned more about the technical side of photography in the last 5 weeks than I did in all that previous time. A perfect spring board to take my photography that step further, and hopefully allow me to do what I love for a living. When time and money allow, I fully intend on going on future courses and workshops."}, {"author": "Janet Boulter", "source": "Trustpilot", "event": "Bluebells", "rating": 5, "date": "02/05/2017 06:41", "review": "Bluebells Definitely worth the early start, excellent morning.

Not being very confident with my new, very red, DSLR I was more than a little apprehensive that I would not learn anything. I am so chuffed that I now have an understanding of the 'triangle' and can start to take photographs without letting the camera do all the work.  I am currently doing the practice excercises that Alan set as 'homework' and am looking forward to attending the next 4 sessions with him. I would highly recommend Alan if you are just starting out on your photography journey. He is an easy going, very knowledgeable professional photographer and having seen a few of his landscapes I can only wish that I can achieve a little of what he has achieved over the years."}, {"author": "D KING", "source": "Trustpilot", "event": "Excellent Beginners Course", "rating": 5, "date": "29/03/2017 19:19", "review": "The initial beginner's course that I attended was the perfect introduction to what could be expected if the extended beginner's course was embarked upon.
